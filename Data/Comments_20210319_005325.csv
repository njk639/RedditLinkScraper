Essentially, I aim to upgrade and add new options for every race in 5e, as well as introduce new Versatile Subraces inspired by Pathfinder 2e's versatile heritages. I will post updates to this project every week. If you have any suggestions, comments, or requests feel free to share. 

For this first entry, I've decided to do my favorite race: Hobgoblins.   The Strongblade Hobgoblin is essentially the original race, the Forge Hobgoblin makes a great artificer, The aquatic Koalinth is an old d&d monster that I'm surprised hasn't been made playable yet, and the Drakogoblin is an original subrace based on Hobgoblins apparent penchant for drakes.

2,grd344y,m7s097,"Hello, everyone!  Hoping to get some serious constructive feedback on this cleric subclass that I've made. Just a little background - I'm planning a campaign that takes place in the Lendore Isles, and there is a church introduced in the Secret of Bone Hill called the ""Church of the Big Gamble.""  I would like to offer my players the chance to become a member of their faith, and 5e lacks a cleric domain that fits this church.  

The Fortune Domain is not about making money, but about good and bad luck.  Clerics manipulate chance for good (fortune) or bad (misfortune), and this subclass plays a support role.  I haven't made too many subclasses for 5e, so I'm looking for some feedback and critiques of this subclass, as well as suggestions for how it might best fit the theme of a cleric manipulating the luck of their own as well as those around them through their connection with their god.

The subclass started off as a non-evil version of the Oathbreaker called the Oathless, but I felt the oath they got kind of completely contradicted it.

The subclass is mostly focused on buffs and more defensive features. It's not looking to change how the class is played entirely but is more focused on keeping you in the fight for as long as possible.

9,gqyg3ll,m56sxy,"I think most people here know by now that WOTC has released an UA which included a new Fairy race. One of the main talking points has been the races size, Small, rather than Tiny. I’ve seen some interesting takes on using small races in games from Kibble’s Revised Fairy Race to Tiny Races Underfoot. My current gaming group was also a bit unhappy with the WOTC version, so I set out to create a fairy that I’d like to include in my world.

I took elements I liked from Tiny Races Underfoot and bits from Kibble’s Revised Fairy Race (both great options, but not quite what I wanted) and a few other ideas that came to me. This is what I threw together this afternoon. It has not been playtested yet, and I’ve only just finished it. I’m still deciding if I like it or not, but I felt I should definitely get some outside input.

My goal here was to create a Glass Cannon race. Small, tender, and easy to crush if you could hit it, but watch out if they get a few spells off, especially in large groups.

The Sub-races is definitely a weak area. I don’t know a whole lot about fairies types, and google brought up a lot of European lore and whatnot that it just too dense to get through in a single afternoon.

1.) The Expanded Spell list usually grants access to spells that warlocks do not have exclusively (such as \*ensnaring strike\* or \*phantasmal killer\*). Many spells on this list are already warlock spells (like \*crown of madness\*). Consider looking at the druid spell list for these. 

2.) A short and long rest ability might be something to look into for level 1, as the current eldritch blast feature is weak compared to other classes (the Fiend gets temp hit points, Fey gets to scare and charm enemies, exc)

As a bonus action, you can choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you that is paralyzed, poisoned, or stunned. The target creature is no longer paralyzed, poisoned, or stunned.

**Blood Curse of Unstanching**  
As a bonus action, you rend the clotting factors in the body of a creature within 30 feet of you, making their blood flow freely. The cursed creature can't regain hit points or become stable. At the end of each of its turns it can make a Constitution saving throw, ending the curse on a success.

27,gq9f1t7,m0qfzy,"This is actually one of my favorite subclasses I’ve made. It borrows a few things from divination Wizard, namely the portent ability. I’ve always found the Cleric subclasses to be lacking in archetypal design. Cleric fills the priest role in 5E, but lacks subclasses that feel priest-like outside of Life Domain, and arguably Grave or Knowledge Domain. I aimed to fix that with an archetypal Oracle subclass. 

Oracles in fantasy have always been some of my favorite characters to write for, as I love the idea of oracles being normal people who are stuck with the gift of prophecy. Realistically, it’s extremely difficult to interpret the future as most Oracles would see it without context. For that reason, most of the Class Features you receive focus on altering specific moments throughout your adventuring day. 

Clerics typically get access to most of the low-mid level divination spells, but it didn’t seem right to not grant them these spells innately. As such, you’ll find that many of the spells you get aren’t new spells, but they are spells that you would likely take anyway, taking a lot of the pressure off the Cleric to prepare all these spells every day.  

The Class Features themselves I found to be challenging to design, as Divination Wizard already presents itself as an Oracle character, but Priests and Clerics are often oracles in fantasy as well. While Prophecy Domain does borrow Portent from the Divination Wizard, it receives plenty of brand new abilities to utilize on adventures.

**Oracle Spirit**- this particular ability is the typical Proficiency/Knowledge ability all clerics receive. I specifically chose two knowledge skills and two face skills to make up the list, determining the Prophets would require these skills for specific reasons
Persuasion: The ability to convince people that they’re telling the truth about the future and attempt to sway them from a path that might lead them to an unsavory end. 
Deception: the ability to lie about the future, possibly to spare a creature from knowledge that would harm them, or even to intentionally steer them towards a future they may wish to avoid. 
Arcana: this one was a little more complex. It made sense to me that oracles would have knowledge of magic and magic items, and skill checks that Arcana is used for seemed to be something that I’d want to be good at if I were using this Domain 
History: it seems to me that it’d be critical for an Oracle or prophet to be able to recall past information as easily as they could foresee future information. If I were playing this subclass, I’d want to be able to easily recall past prophecies, even ones I didn’t foretell myself.  

**Fortune Teller**- similar to Bardic Inspiration or the various +1d4 spells like aid, this ability exists as a way for the Cleric to help guide a character towards their destiny. As opposed to simply telling a character their future, Fortune Teller gently nudges the PC towards a favorable outcome.

**Channel Divinity: Divine Insight**- instead of relying on your own knowledge, this feature attempts to make use of your gods knowledge, allowing you to cast divination spells without expending a spell slot. Divination Wizard gets the extremely potent Expert Divination ability, which creates a very helpful trickle down of your spell slots, allowing you to cast a good handful of your divination spells before an important encounter. While probably not as potent, a free casting of a divination spell a few times a day can be extremely impactful. Remember that you get up to 3 uses between short rests, so you could potentially use this up to 9 times per session, maybe more. Even at low levels you should get a couple uses of this per session. 

**Fortelling Dream**- try as I might, I simply couldn’t compete with Divination Wizard. Portent is an extremely powerful ability, so it felt unfair to not let Prophecy Domain use it too. It’s called Fortelling Dream because initially, I wanted to give the Cleric a way to see the future through dreams, but aside from giving the DM control of this ability and letting them decide to share information with the PC through a Dream, there wasn’t much else I could think of besides Portent. 

**Potent Spellcasting**- it was this or divine strike, and this class is not a front liner. 

**High Prophet**- Cleric doesn’t normally get Foresight, which felt like an *over*sight to me. A free casting of this spell is extremely powerful, and as such is limited to once at least every other day, and at most, once a week. It initially had a static time limit of one week, but it felt too restrictive. The way it’s written now prevents it from coming up too many times in one session. There’s actually a typo here. The way it’s written makes it sound like you still require material components. You do not. It should say “without expending a spell slot *or* requiring material components.” I’ll get that fixed soon. 

This is for sure one of my favorite subclasses, at least in terms of flavor. Like I said, I love Oracles in fantasy, and Divination Wizard just doesn’t really do it for me.

## Greater Speedy Courier

*6th-level conjuration (ritual)*

* **Casting Time:** 1 action
* **Range:** 15 feet
* **Components:** V, S, M (40 gold pieces, or mineral goods of equivalent value, which the spell consumes or one chest miniature of a set of two, each worth at least 400 gp)
* **Duration:** 1 hour
* **Classes:** Warlock, Wizard

You summon a Medium air elemental to a spot within range. The air elemental is formless, nearly transparent, immune to all damage, and cannot interact with other creatures or objects. It carries an open, empty chest whose interior dimensions are four feet on each side. Besides a lid, the chest also has a latching mechanism on the front face that allows the top two feet of the face to swing down, making the bottom of the chest accessible.

While the spell lasts, you can deposit as many items inside the chest as will fit. You can then name a living creature you have met and seen at least once before or present a body part, such as a lock of hair or nail clipping, from a creature with which you are unfamiliar. When you do so, the elemental disappears with the chest, then reappears adjacent to the target creature. If the target creature is on another plane, or if it is proofed against magical detection or location, the elemental fails to deliver the chest.

Upon delivery, the target creature is made aware of the chest’s contents before it chooses whether or not to open it. It also learns how long it has before the chest is returned. No other creature can open the chest, access its contents, or stow objects in it. The elemental stays with the chest until either the spell expires or the target creature orders the elemental to return the chest to you. Before that time, the target creature may freely take objects from and place objects into the chest.

When the elemental returns the chest (either because it couldn't deliver it to the target, the target ordered it to return, or the spell ended), it reappears adjacent to you, deposits the chest on the ground, and disappears. You are made aware of the contents of the chest before you choose whether or not to open it. The chest disappears and spills its contents in ten minutes or when the spell expires, whichever is longer.

If you cast this spell using the chest miniature as the material component, you may only send the chest to the owner of the other chest miniature in the set. You can designate a creature as the owner of a chest miniature with a special ritual casting of this spell when you, the creature, and both miniatures are within range. The elemental fails to find the target if you cast the spell in this way and the target is more than 100 feet from its chest miniature.

When you cast this spell ritually, you may only cast it using a chest miniature as the material component.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, you can send the chest to a creature on a different plane of existence from you.",UnearthedArcana,"Greater Speedy Courier – 6th-Level Conjuration (Ritual) – ""Greater"" Version of Galder's Speedy Courier",Spell

This subclass is themed around slight time-bending and seizing the opportunities that affords. Its mechanics are intended to be basic and simple, focused on synergyzing with the Monk's class kit.

The 3rd level ability focuses on seeing the immediate future and seizing that advantage in battle. It does that by reacting prematurely to combat breaking out, and taking advantage of a foe's failure to punish them at that same moment.

The 6th level ability both gives him an ability to weave through the flow of time to either grant him an advantage in battle by dodging (blur, synergizing with Punishing Strike) or moving in the blink of an eye (misty step), as well as allow the use of its foresight capabilities outside of battle (augury and guidance).

The 11th level ability is meant to buff the regular ki features, since monk lags a bit behind at tiers 3 and 4. This is meant to help them stay on par with other classes.

The 17th level ability is meant to reflect the mastery of their capabilities, being able to act an extra time in battle. Its based on the Thief Rogue's level 17 ability, but with added versatility. This versatility  is the reason it can only be used once between rests.

I've considered changing the level 3 and 6 abilities, since I feel  Punishing Strike may be a bit too strong at that level, but I've kept them this way, because it fits the narrative of the subclass better.",UnearthedArcana,Way of Chronal Flow - a Monk Tradition where you manipulate time to improve your martial craft!,Subclass

So, as many other DMs do, I've reached the point where I feel the need to re-do Ranger so that any of my players that want to play Ranger can do so without feeling like they're picking something sub-optimal. My main purpose here was to stay true to the main idea of the PHB ranger, while adding just a little bit to who they are and what they can do. The main issue i wanted to address is that Ranger doesn't really incentivize sticking around for later levels. All you really get are extra spell slots (which could easily be obtained with a few levels in druid) and basic abilities that other classes get way earlier. I've added and changed things to hopefully incentivize players to want to take a ranger all the way up to level 20. I also wanted to address the fact that favored terrain either makes the survival pillar irrelevant, or is useless. I kept this compatible with the regualr ranger sub-classes, which means this will (probably) probably work with any homebrew sub-classes.

The version I posted is a little strong on purpose, I wanted feedback on that quickly.

The biggest thing here is changing ""Natural Explorer"" and several other class features from levels where the feature is something very simple into what I have called ""Survival Techniques."" They're a group of small bonuses which you get to choose from, gaining additional options as you level up, similarly to a warlock's eldritch invocations.

The first thing I changed was moving the fighting style to level 1, and moving the terrain/exploration feature to level 2. I think this emphasizes the Rangers martial role, and allows the ranger to more fully specialize in their specific style of hunting right off the bat. Favored enemy has been effectively copied from the ""The Ranger, Revised"" UA, with the addition that with enough time and training, players can change their Favored Enemy so that they don't lose out on one of their main features when they aren't fighting that thing. Because they can now change out their Favored Enemy, I've brought the language feature into it's own feature called ""Language of the Land.""  


At level 2, they get Spellcasting as usual, though now they automatically learn \*hunter's mark\*, and it doesn't count against their spells known. They also get their first 3 survival techniques; these allow for greater customization and specialization. The ranger they make will really be their own.  


3rd level sees them getting their Ranger Archetype as usual, as well as my first addition: Healing Poultices. The poulices are made to be potent out of combat healing. The medicine check means it synergizes well with two of the Survival Techniques, and it also allows other features to augment it, and I love letting players use their abilities together. The alternate use helps the ranger be a little more willing to lose those valuable concentration spells when the situation calls for it.

The next several levels are more or less standard, gaining a few extra survival techniques as they level up.   


10th level sees an improvement to the poultices, upgrading their healing abilities to stay relevant with higher health pools, and increasing the number of conditions it can remove. I roughly followed the pattern set by the alchemist artificer's free uses of greater and lesser restoration.  


13th level adds ""Combat Prowess"", which is designed to emphasize the Ranger's role as a master of slaying and hunting. The options (extra attack, improved crit chances, extra favored enemy, or an ASI) were meant to be comparable, though not necessarily all perfectly equivalent.   


18th level's ""Feral Senses"" is an expansion of the intention of the original version of this feature: make the ranger capable of seeing things they normally couldn't, and also giving the player another opportunity to customize their character to their specific style. Just to clarify, the ""Perfect Darkvision"" does not have a range limit, and does effectively mean that the Ranger can not have vision obscured in any way by any kind of darkness.  


The original Foeslayer is meant to make you better at killing things. It sort of does this, but it's rather lack luster. I changed it to an ability that makes you hit your Favored Enemies reliably. This ability actually gets less useful if your character is good at hitting their targets already, so it can also be used to help their allies.",UnearthedArcana,"The Ranger, Revamped v1.0.

71,dnh88qv,728jog,"Being able to *select* three weapons that you are proficient in is...highly unusual, to say the least. I'd recommend just picking ones that make sense. Rapiers and longswords are a good fit for vampires in my opinion. Maybe just the same proficiencies as a rogue.

> You are considered Undead as well as Humanoid for all purposes

This is unclear. What exactly does it mean? If a spell says it ""has no effect on undead"" does it work on you, since you ""are considered...humanoid for all purposes""? My suggestion: either turn the character directly into undead, or follow the cue of the [vryloka](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/VydFOpkag) and specify that the character can choose whether to count as undead or humanoid in any given case.

Vulnerability to silvered weapons is unorthodox, but still, I really like it.

For a vampire, I feel that having the same weakness in sunlight as a drow is just now good enough. The penalty should be much steeper.

The flaw you've given for needing to drink blood is wholly insufficient. I would again point you to the vryloka's penalty for not drinking enough, as well as to Walrock's [vampire prestige class](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwF09f1afXWlcVNHTk1wU1U1ZTQ/view) for some good examples of how to do weakness in not drinking blood (the latter also has a good example for sunlight).

I feel that the vampire claws being such a central mechanic is a mistake. Yes, vampires do infamously have sharp claws that they can use in many iterations. But it's not a central part of their concept, so it feels odd to use it as the core scaling mechanic. I would have made it a static little perk that they get, rather than such a central part of them.

Tunnel Fighter is widely regarded as massively overpowered and should not be encouraged by allowing it here.

In my opinion, reducing an opponent's damage by a certain amount is an odd effect for drinking their blood to have. Instead I would suggest making the target have *disadvantage* on their next attack.

***

At this point, I've gotten to 5th level, and I'm noticing some major problems. The first is that two of the core, most important parts of vampirism have not been even remotely represented yet. By 5th level all of the core ideas should have been introduced. In fact, really, even by 3rd level you should be able to fully recognise everything.

There has been no seduction, no charming or beguiling abilities. And there has been no amount of transformation. No bat form or mist form. And that is a major problem at this point. I can see from the table that the transformation stuff comes later, and that one of the subclasses deals with the beguiling. But that's too little and too late. A core part of the concept's identity should not be *only* available by subclass, or not represented until level **9**.

***

Infection should be based on the target making a saving throw. Probably constitution, but I guess a charisma or wisdom save could also work. Set it to 8+prof+cha.

Praetor's Chosen is a pretty cool capstone, but the sidebar about knight retainers makes it a lot less interesting. That feature is specifically intended to not be too useful, balanced for 1st level characters to be able to get it for free. A capstone shouldn't need that same limitation.

> When you make a successful attack roll against a creature, all following attacks gain a +2 to their attack and damage rolls

Is that meant to be a permanent bonus? That seems way too powerful if so. How long is it meant to last?

I find the ""centred on the raven"" aspect of Darkness Prevails"" rather odd. What's the thematic justification for this limit? It doesn't come from anywhere in folklore that I can think of, or any other iterations of vampirism.

Similarly, what's the flavour justification for Solace of Shadow?

Other than that, both the predator and shadow subclasses are absolutely brilliant.

The sanguimancer is mechanically alright, but thematically I find it a little disappointing. Other 3rd casters get some minor ability apart from spellcasting at 3rd level. Arcane Tricksters with their special *mage hand*, Eldritch Knights with their bound weapons. This could have some minor flavourful ability.

The level 10 and 15 abilities are decent mechanically (Dominance Acquisition might be a little weak for such a high level ability), but mechanically just...dull. There's nothing about them that I find evocative or interesting.

I mentioned earlier that I thought the sanguimancer would be the subclass centred around the vampire's beguiling nature. I was disappointed when I looked at the abilities to find that apart from having access to a couple of spells that can be used in that way, it actually really *isn't* the subclass I was exepecting. This might not have been so much of a problem if the core class had done its job here, but this is essentially a double whammy of lame.

Over all, I thought this was a pretty good start. But it needs quite a bit of work to be considered really *good*.

81,ec5p113,a7op4t,"Hallo there! Let's see what we have here:

I recommend using [Homebrewery](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com) or [GM Binder](https://www.gmbinder.com) for formatting and designing your brew.

**Hardware.** Hit Dice, proficiencies, equipments. So far so good.

**Spellcasting.** The table shows that you are a half-level spellcaster and you gain spellcasting at 1st level? And it goes all up to 15 spells (instead of 11, like ranger)?

You said you want to make the class ""less reliant on cantrips,"" but you have more cantrips available than druid, and actually have as much cantrips as sorcerer. Normally a half-level spellcaster does *not* gain access to cantrip with Spellcasting feature at all; instead they gain some other means to boost their combat and non-combat capabilitieis through other features.

The long, shiny flavor on how shaman spells are spontaneous and all, is irrelevant in 5th edition.

I don't think allowing to cast spells as ritual is really necessary for half-level spellcaster.

The feature description says you use ""shamanic focus"" but you start with a ""druidic fous.""

If you want to make it more like warlock, try using Pact Magic (less spell slots, replenishes on short rest).

**Totem.** Building a totem is painstaking and costly, it can't help you in a fast-paced combat and adventures in general. How about you use a bonus action to ""summon"" a totem in an unoccupied space you can see, say, 10 feet of you (later 30 feet)?

I will leave my comments on each totem on separate comment.

**Regional Attunement.** This is only valid if you go for Pact Magic (spell slot level progression completes at 9th level). For a half-level spellcaster, not so much.

**Ritual Channeling.** Makes no sense. Technically you have to perform at least 10 mintues of rituals to cast a spell this way, and I'm not sure if anyone within the area will be so happy to just stay there for the whole time. This looks like a blatant way to cast a spell without expending a spell slot, which is a no-no without good reasons.

**Spiritual Guidance.** Both spells are 2nd-level spells, which are not supposed to available to you until 3rd level (for full-level spellcaster) or 5th level (for half-level spellcaster, like this version of shaman).

**Ethereal Form.** Looks awfully similar to *astral projection* spell. See monk's Empty Body feature to see how it's done for that class.

Why use reaction? Why not just bonus action or action? Reaction must have a triggering event.

**EC: Bonus Cantrips.** Uh, you already have like four cantrips, do you really need two more? Where is the ""less reliant to cantrips"" part you promised?

**EC: Elemental Boon.** If a spell requires you to make a d20 roll, then typically it's an attack roll, and you already have critical hits for that. Cantrip also already has level-incremental damage boost. Do you really need this?

**EC: Regional Spirits.** So these spells do not cout against the number of spells you know, right? Please be more specific.

And why only 2nd-level spells? Go for Land druid's Circle Spell list and add some more, if you really want these kind of features.

**EC: Elemental Charm.** You're casting a 5th-level spell once per short rest, when you are only supposed to cast up to 3rd-level spells. Compare warlock's Minions of Chaos invocation, which expends a spell slot (5th at that level) *and* is only available once between long rests.

**EC: Elemental Overload.** No, this is a blatant way to abuse how spell slots should work.

**FC: Fury.** You are already proficient in medium armors.

This is a cheaper version of barbarian's Rage, but you can cast spells while you're at it. I'm not sure if you really need this kind of bonus.

**FC: Regional Spirits Aura.** Is suspiciously familiar from Storm Herald barbarian's feature.

**FC: Windfury.** With no strings attached? Two-weapon fighting comes with a price (you must take the Attack action on your turn; you do not add your ability modifier to the damage roll, unless you have Two-Weapon Fighting style). Try War cleric's War Priest feature (use limits).

**FC: Relentless Fury.** Is barbarian's Relentless Rage.

**FC: Greater Spirit.** Resistance do not stack, and you do not take quarter damage.

---

Overall, what I see is a half-level druid but tries to be more than it should be. I will be commenting on totems, which should be more of a shtick of the class, but for now I don't think you would even need these with all the overpowered features the class currently has.",UnearthedArcana,Shaman Class (My first homebrew class),Class
82,e3cxmyj,93bnp3,"Hallo there! Let's see what your player has brewed:

I can suggest your player to use [Homebrewery](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com) or [GM Binder](http://www.gmbinder.com) if he/she keeps his homebrewing career and is looking for better formatting and templates.

**Combat Wild Shape.** Straight from Moon druid, confirmed and reliable.

**Draconic Form.** Now this must be the bread and butter of this subclass.

Essentially, this is just your typical Wild Shape with even more goodies on top of it. I am against the bonus of sorcerer's Draconic Resilience on top of what you already have in the Wild Shape because of the following reasons:

- The choice is either chromatic or metallic? Why not use the dragon table like Draconic Bloodline sorcerer?
- The purpose of Wild Shape is to use an alternative hit points and statistics instead of yours, essentially increasing your hit point maximum by the amount of your Wild Shape form. Increasing even more on top of that seems too much.
- Many creatures already have natural armor of some sort, either from thick hide, scales, and what you have.
- The ritual does not need an ability check if you have to have direct contact toward the said creature for 10 minutes. The contact itself can be an encounter of its own for your druid, and your party have to protect the druid for 10 minutes while he/she performs the ritual.

**Draconic Strike.** The point of you assuming the Strength and Dexterity of your Wild Shape form is to use that statistics for attacks while you are in that form. Using Wisdom for attack makes the druid SAD, or Single Ability Dependent, which is probably one of the first signs of munchkins and minmaxing. (I must say I have some grudge toward excessive minmaxing, so I have to propose my apologies for a bit of hair-trigger here.)

Druid already have good list of damaging cantrips (including *primal savagery*), weapon attacks, Wild Shape attacks *and* full-level spellcasting progression. I don't see why you even need additional cantrip at all, especially when this subclass is clearly a Wild Shape-focused one.

**Draconic Wild Shape.** Young dragon I can cope with, but the problem is that the new form gains benefit from Draconic Strike (Wisdom-based damage that deals either slashing or one another damage type). I mean, a young dragon is already a powerful creature, but you need even more on top of that?

**Thousand Forms.** Essentially Moon druid's feature *plus* growing a pair of wings that has little description. If you want flying speed, go for *fly*.

Using a catch-all shape seems nice at first glance, but the problem is that it's not that necessary at all. Note how Moon druid's Elemental Form did not do it that way.

**Draconic Body** and **Improved Draconic Wild Shape.** 18th level is *not* when you gain a druid subclass feature. Unless it's very necessary, I would say this is going too much.

I don't see why you even need to replace Timeless Body, that was already a purely ribbon feature that would take effect very rarely. Slowing your age progression even further seems a bit redundant.

For Improved Draconic Wild Shape, the same comment applies: You don't actually need to make a new stat block just for this subclass feature.

You compared this feature with the *shapeshift* spell, but I see otherwise, because of the following reasons:

- *Shapeshift* lasts up to 1 hour and requires concentration, meaning that whenever you take damage there is a chance of the spell ending. Wild Shape lasts up to 9 hours at 18th level, and it does not require concentration, and in fact, by 18th level a druid can actually cast a spell that requires concentration while he/she is in the Wild Shape.
- *Shapeshift* requires a material component that costs at least 1,500 gp, which the spell consumes. By 18th level that could be a cheap price, but still, you don't need to pay even that with your Wild Shape.
- *Shapeshift* consumes a 9th-level spell slot, which is given only once at 17th level, and replenishes on a long rest. A 20th-level druid has unlimited use of Wild Shape, meaning that if a druid wants, he/she can be a dragon for the rest of his/her life.

Overall, I am afraid to say that this subclass is just a modified and highly overpowered version of Moon druid. I understand the sheer badassery of a druid who can transform into a dragon, but I must inquire one thing for your player: Is copypasting Moon druid and slapping in some overpowered feature the best effort? I would suggest using more creative and interesting features, something like this:

- You can expend a Wild Shape use to give yourself a buff that resembles the half-dragon template (*Monster Manual*, page 180).
- While in Wild Shape, expend a spell slot as an action to simulate the dragon's breath weapon.
- While in Wild Shape, you gain resistance to the damage type associated with the dragon type.
- You can simulate some of the dragon's lair actions by expending spell slot.
- You can simulate the dragon's Frightful Presence or other bennies.

**Is this not a bit OP? -** I am not sure frankly. Balance on this is a bit harder to judge, but since it has no subrace I allowed myself a bit higher power ceiling. It also has a bunch of features which lack standing in mechanical reality. The can not predict future actions bit or the innate hints on how to destroy objects are wholly and fully subject to GM interpretation and ruling. How the GM uses utilizes them and how much information they give out to player depends on importance of these to the campaign and their style. This is not a typical design for 5e homebrew, however I do dabble in both OSR movement games and storygames. As such, it came across that way and frankly I will keep it.  
As for Detect Balance score it is somewhere in the range of 30 However, I do not consider DB to be end-all to making homebrew races. This does not mean much for me but it may to you.   


**Choose your ASI sucks.** Freeform ASI is the way I play these days and it never broke anything. That said I also play with people who do not minmax and do not need their reins kept in check (is that the expression). A good array for +ASI for Catboys is +2 Cha and +1 Wis if you require something standard.

I had a few things in mind as I designed the archetype: **OVERWHELMING AND BRUTE STRENGTH**, the Warrior class from WoW (see the Brutality Points mechanic), and /u/MatthewMercer's [Gunslinger Class](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjasbe554LOAhVLHGMKHcpRDmwQFggcMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dmsguild.com%2Fproduct%2F170778%2FGunslinger-Martial-Archetype-for-Fighters&usg=AFQjCNHG1cd1-to2ISOpTi4W-yQ0NE0XhA&sig2=r1BzKuNMnW4oZwN8DLYs1g&bvm=bv.127521224,d.cGc). So hopefully that gives you some sense of the flavor I'm going for.

I am well aware that this archetype is probably horribly imbalanced (that's where I'm hoping you'll all come in), and it is as yet un-playtested. Further, the level 14 feature, Annihilating Strikes, is sort of a placeholder at the moment.

92,dt5sax6,7slpch,"If this is your first ever homebrew, it's probably not a good idea to make a class. Classes are **really** hard to do.

This kinda shows that you don't yet have a strong enough understanding of the fundamentals of 5e class design to be attempting this. Simple mistakes like lacking a clear identity in both flavour and mechanics, not designing it to have significant power boosts at new tier levels (levels 5, 11, and 16), having no subclass, giving players a very wide range of choice for saving throw proficiencies, but where most of those choices would result in a poorly built class (two weak saves, instead of one weak, one strong), getting more customisable proficiency options than even the rogue &mdash; the supposed skill monkey of the game &mdash; an incorrect spell slot progression, and more.

Classes in 5e are designed with a strong flavour-based reason to exist first, and mechanics are built to follow that. This just feels like a weird mish-mosh of stuff other people get, plus double casting and spell siphoning. Very few of the abilities you get seem to be useful in exploration or social encounters, they all seem to be combat-focused. And many of the abilities are written in ways that raise very serious questions about how they would even work. To name just a few of these problems:

* (How) does Double Casting work with AoE spells or spells that don't target a specific creature?
* How does the warlock's Superior Magic Feature work? Do you get only Mystic Arcanum (6th level), or do you also get 7th and 8th levels?
* What happens if you choose ""**Bard** you gain the cutting words class feature..."" without choosing ""**Bard** you gain the bardic inspiration feature...""?

With these, and others, the intended answer might or might not be obvious. That's not the point. The point is that as it's presented, it's not very well written.

I would strongly encourage you to try your hand at some smaller homebrews. Some races or subclasses, first. Or consider a way in which the Red Mage can be designed as a particular multiclass path, maybe with a custom feat, magic item, or similar to give you the double casting stuff. Remember, one of the most important basic tenets of homebrew is that if it *can* be done by reflavouring or making minor tweaks to existing material, it *should* be done that way. If not, then if it *can* be done through a smaller unit like a race, subclass, or prestige class, it *should*. 

If you're interested, this is far from perfect, but I feel it gets the basic principles of 5e class design pretty good.

A few thoughts:

I feel like there might be too many abilities now. Each feature, aside from **Diverse Research**, has at least two different things that it does.

~~I don't think the extra spells from **Arcane Savant** are all that powerful, considering the fact that wizards generally learn a ton of spells from scrolls and such, but it's something I'd get rid of with no qualms if it seems to be unbalanced.~~ Got rid of them.

~~I'm also a bit concerned about the balance of **Arcana Majeure**. I feel like it might be better if it were either use one of the abilities per long rest, or the other.~~ Changed it to either disadvantage on saving throws against a spell (per short rest) or ~~auto-fail a saving throw against a spell (legendary resistance must be used twice).~~ improved **Arcane Recovery**, with spell slots with a combined level of 3/4 your wizard level. The same limitations still apply to **Arcane Recovery** as in the RAW, and it's either **Arcane Recovery** or giving disadvantage, not both.

Lastly, although I haven't significantly changed **Eldritch Master** from the last version of this, I did limit the creation of spell slots levels 6 through 9 to once per long rest. ~~I also added more prepared spells.~~ I am considering getting rid of the spell slot conversion entirely, however. One idea I like, after coming across it in other Arcane Tradition homebrews, is to expand **Arcane Recovery**, the base class feature, to recover spell slots with a combined level equivalent to 3/4 your wizard level.

102,dre3k41,7kfvx6,"You, like most people who revise the ranger simply don't get that it's not acceptable to tie mechanical power to DM dependant choices. See, Favoured enemy on the PHB ranger was bad, because it basically gave a few fluff bits and that was your level 1 ribbon (don't put ribbons at level 1). You've done the UA thing where you attached bonuses to attacks and damage, based on if the DM gives you the right opponent. This can be very swingy and not at all fun to deal with. The scaling up on it just makes the problem worse.

The solution is to remove bonuses to attacks and damage, then allow actual flexibility in the flavour ribbon so that players can handle changing campaigns.

Natural Explorer removes any terrain restriction, which is nice. However, it does have the sad feature of ""your group cannot become lost"". Remove the word group. Things like that that trivialise the exploration pillar of the game should not be included. Advantages to travelling overland, sure. Triviliasing? No.

I notice Hunters Mark is still a spell. Not helpful.

Primeval Awareness, also known as ""do you realise how much stuff is within 5 miles"". 5 miles is actually huge. The GM has to have directions, numbers and types for what works out to be a very large number of creatures. The distance on this feature needs to be toned down a lot.

Range Strider has exactly one useful benefit, and that's the nonmagical difficult terrain in combat. Even that's pretty niche, most difficult terrain is magically generated. The plants bit is so niche as to be redundant, and the not slowing down group overland travel again, works to trivialise dangerous terrain travel.

Hide in Plain Sight was a worthless feature as PHB written, but simply ""lol, get disadvantage when I Hide"" is awesome. It's a really good way of doing it. I'd add in a rider ""if you have prepared suitable camouflage, you may attempt to hide by pressing yourself up against a vertical surface.""

Feral Senses: ""While you are not blinded or deafened, gain 30 ft blindsight""

Foe Slayer is so BORING. Other classes have cool capstones this is just some kind of oh, yeah, better add this to make sure I hit.

Hunter:

Practiced Mark. Thank goodness some spell slot relie.... whoops. No spell slot relief. ""This feature saves you one spell slot per day."" The main problem with hunters mark is that it's concentration, and to get the long duration, you need to use high level spell slots (to minimise slots used). This needs to be something like ""wis mod per day""

Stratagems is a nice way of presenting the combat buffs, but you miss that they were deliberately ""chose one of these three"", because clearly you want Colossus Slayer and Horde Breaker at level 3, and that's quite silly. What's more, you've strictly weakened Escape the Horde, (disadvantage is technically a +5 mod), and Multiattack Defense which was weak as anything before.

Evasion at 7th level is nice. 

Master Strategist: ""Get wismod uses of a d4 bonus per short rest."" That's weak. Scrap it entirely, put in a real 15th level feature.

At this point I can see what you're doing, and the problem is that you're not understanding the actual problems with the ranger. The ranger has not enough spells learned, has extreme competition for concentration, has class features that are locked to DM fiat on giving the right opponents.... Still, you push on with these, and there are more subclasses to review.

Beastmaster:

""It loses the Multiattack action, if it normally has this action option."" This is really, really bad. See, almost all CR1/4 animals do about the same amount of DPR. The problem is that some get multi attack to do it. So by removing this, you're arbitrarily crippling a section of the options presented. The rest of it is ok, but really, the beastmaster as presented here isn't inspiring, isn't going to be effective, and really is just a ranger without a subclass. The only bonus to the ranger themselves is Instinctive Bond. I've written a ranger rewrite myself, and my beastmaster gets 3 self applicable features.

Gloom Stalker: The first really solid subclass. A variety of defensive, offensive, tactical and strategic choices. The Shadowy Defence is especially nice.

Horizon Walker is something I have serious issues anyway, and so it's unfair for me to review.

The Monster Slayer is very effective, with just enough flavour elements to really show that's meant to be used against spell-casters and enemies that make you make saving throws.

One-third spellcaster for fighter sounds solid. It's a good starting point.

Divine Strike restricts the probability of using more divine domain. While fitting for a fighter, I see some potentials that are lost here. Besides, fighter won't miss a mere 1d8 (later 2d8) damage when it has up to four Extra Attacks.

Divine Strike also comes a bit late for a fighter class feature, too: For cleric, 8th level is fitting because it's the secondary DPS at best; not so much for fighter. It's a bit of a norm for a 7th-level fighter class feature to be more exploration-oriented (War Magic nonwithstanding), so you can try it that way.

War Divinity needs more clarification. ""Positive effect"" can be situational; does *gust of wind* used to ward off allies from harm counts as positive?

Divine Aura is nice.

Radiant Weapon is, I am afraid to say, a bit bland and simple for a cornerstone feature. Fitting, yes, but I think you might need some more than just dealing more damage.

I can suggest some things like this:
- Channel Divinity, once per short rest, much like paladin. This is a good way to utilize a particularly powerful feature for a divine-themed class and subclass.
- Synergy with spellcasting. War Divinity attempts this, but I think a fighter deserves a bit more. You might want to check cleric, wizard (Bladesinger and War Magic), and warlock features to see how to combine weapon attacks and spellcasting.

I took inspiration from both sources, the manga and the anime, to satisfy both sides. Sadly not all her powers could be included as some would be way to strong or made her go above CR 30, which is not really possible I believe.

**V1.0.1**

* Blood Ties (note, now need to change name)
   * Just a bonus action (doesn't need to hit with weapon attack)
   * Restrained, not incapacitated
   * Dex save changed to Str save
   * 1 enemy at a time
   * Recharge on short rest (Might change)
* Trapping Twine
   * Completely reworked feature (credit to u/SpareProperty for inspiration)
   * New feature reads:
      * At 14th level as an action, you can create a flurry of stronger cords to lash out from you. All creatures of your choice within 15 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC.
      * On a fail, they're grappled for the next minute
      * A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Charisma (Athletics) check.
      * When you move, all creatures grappled by you maintain their position relative to you, provided there are no obstacles in the way. If there are, while you and all other creatures move, the creature unable to do so stays in its position.
      * You can use this feature once, and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
* Formatting
   * Moved credits from end of second column to after text on first to accomodate longer descriptions

   * Currently changed to Cha mod per short rest, though may change to Cha Mod + half Proficiency per long rest

**V1.0.3:**

* Formatting
   * Typo fix, 'Knotword' -> 'Knotwork'
   * Removed lovecaco artwork, beautiful piece, though as pointed out by multiple people, this subclass is falling into the horny bard meme a bit much at the moment, and the art, especially that piece, is the main reason for it.
      * Currently looking for a piece to replace it
* **New Feature:**  Tapestry of Thoughts (credit to u/capncapitalism for inspiration)
   * New feature reads:
      * Many Bards of this college create vast tapestries, not only showing their adventures, but telling them too.
      * You gain proficiency in weavers tools, and you learn the *Encode Thoughts* cantrip, when you cast it, the duration changes to 'until dispelled', and you can determine the appearance of the string.

**V1.0.4:**

* Tapestry of Thoughts
   * Renamed to Trade of Thoughts (placeholder)
   * Added ideas for changing appearence of the string (Ribbons/Rope)
   * Changed flavourtext, 'Many Bards of this college create vast tapestries, not only showing their adventures, but telling them too.' -> 'Many Bards of this college create great works of art, not only showing their skills, but telling them too.'
   * Added section about using your creations as focuses",UnearthedArcana,Bardic College: College of the Cord || A string art/shibari themed Bard subclass,Subclass

* Simplified weapon and armor proficiency limits by class 
* Feats for specific weapon groups  (adding a sense of weapon progress without, hopefully, being a pain to follow)
* Updated skills and skill proficiency selection upon character development
* Additional skill specialties (kind of similar to feats, but simply add flavor to characters)
* A few homebrew rules, most notably the ""Death by Exhaustion""

Everything is up for grabs (love/hate feedback). I have yet to play test this, but I think it's at a good spot to get a group together and run a few sessions. I'm really happy with the updated Feats list, which took me a couple of months and takes in suggestions from a bunch of sources (including some youtubers).

I know that the equipment proficiency will be polarizing and I'm on the fence whether this belongs in 5E. But for now I would specifically love feedback on: 

* Does anything feel unbalanced (between class proficiencies, or specific feat tweaks)
* Any suggestions on different approaches, specifically with the skills section, which was really kind of a brainchild of u/SamuraiHealer
* Any additional feats or concepts that could make this even more complete (although this is already larger than I was hoping to make it at first).

Hey there
So here is an update to my Soul Binder class, there are minor tweaks and changes here and there, and gave the archetypes some changes to keep them more balanced but still feel unique. Also in this version is the Bond of the Merged, where you can become one with your companion, hope you all enjoy. Sadly due to reddit only allowing 20 pictures to be posted at a time the Example companion page is only part of the PDF and GMbinder, will have to figure out how to post this class in the future when I add more subclasses, because it will be more than 20 pictures.

## Changelog
### Core Class
* Changed Magic Item Absorbtion so only items that require attunement takes an attunement slot from the Soul Binder, the companion can absorb a maximum of three items.
* Fixed some grammar and wording.
* Changed the Tough archetypes HP to be: 5 + (3 + its Constitution mdofieri) * your Soul Binder level
* Added changed the name of the ""Plated"" archetype to ""Resilient"" and give it resistance to one damage type from a list.
* Added clause that you can only pick an evolution once (unless otherwise specifed)
* Added to ""Bonded Companion"" so you can communicate telepathically with your companion, like the ""Find Familiar"" spell
* Changed ""Pocket Dimension"" from ""Hidden Form"" so you can make your companion appear as a bonus action.
* Changed ""Benefit of the Bond: Arcane"" to give two spells each level instead of one.
* Added the ""Speech"" evolution if you want your companion to speak.
* Added edict die to the class table.
* Changed the level that the edict die increases to a 1d8 to 14th level from 17th level.
* The ""Spider Climb"" evolution now gives a climbing speed.
* ""Soul Infused Giant"" now makes your companion gargantuan instead of increasing its size by two.
* Added the ""Skilled"" evolution
* Added the ""helpful"" evolution
* Added the ""adorable"" evolution
* Added the ""spell link"" evolution
* Reduced the ""Tough"" archetypes base AC to 9 from 10

#### Bond to the Unknown

\[Edit 1\]:     Added the possibility to choose between bludgeoning and thunder damage when making a Guitar Smash attack, and made the unarmed strike and guitar smash die scale alongside bardic inspiration.

\[Edit 2\]:     Changed the wording on the 14th level ability for clarity. Modified the damage from 1d4 + str mod to 2d4 + bard's cha mod, and made it a reaction for the allies.

\[Edit 3\]:     Modified the 6th level ability. The ability works similar to counterspell, so, when trying to use it against any spell of 4th level or higher, it requires a check, to which you can add Bardic Inspiration. You can see the updated version on GM Binder.

I've had a lot of fun coming up with ideas for this subclass, (I think the flavor text might still be a bit messy in parts), and I really wanted to put it out there and see what you guys think.

So if you have any, let me know, I'm happy to work on it more, to get it to a place where it's usable in an actual game.

If you enjoyed this and want to see more, worry not, there will be more coming. And if you end up actually playing a Punk-Rock bard in one of your games, let me know your thoughts on how it's holding up!

Ever wanted to yell ""stop hitting yourself"" at an enemy? *Reversal* might be the spell for you.

Continuing on with new reaction spells for the classes, *reversal* is a 3rd-level spell that allows you to swap places with an opponent mid attack, forcing them to attack themselves.

I agonized a bit over what level to put this spell at. At first, I was thinking it was way overpowered. Reversing a *guiding bolt* could be game changing! But, looking at some of the stronger creatures and spells in the game, there doesn't seem to be anything game breaking that requires a ranged attack.

That's not to say the spell is useless. Really the utility of this spell is to re-position enemy characters forcefully. The potential extra damage on top is a nice perk.

Some tricky strategies I can imagine with this spell:

* Some obnoxious low CR guards or kobolds flinging bolts at you and your friends from up high? Swap places with one of them to get on their level.
* Use the *fly* spell and go harass some ranged casters. Then, watch them fall to the ground after you switch places with them.
* Need to get out of your location and fast? Have an ally throw a dart at you and swap places with them. Sure, they'll get hurt, but *you'll be fine.*

Feedback welcome! I'm already anticipating people getting on my case for making it an Intelligence save... 😅

# Ranger Archetypes

**Bounty Hunter.** Bounty Hunter / Urban Ranger is a popular homebrew archetype, and here is my take on it. I thought it’d be interesting to give a Ranger that specializes in hunting other people some combat maneuvers to aid in their ability to take in their quarry, dead or alive! 

**Exorcist.** Part of my ongoing [Blood Hunter: Dissected](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MJZYIYDTnRm7GURb32e) project, the Exorcist is a reimagining of the Order of the Ghostslayer archetype. One part Ranger, one part Paladin, one part Ghost. Any fans of Danny Phantom?

**Grim Huntsman.** Also part of my Blood Hunter: Dissected, the Grim Huntsman is an attempt to preserve the themes of the base Blood Hunter class without potentially killing your own character. Disclaimer: This is probably the edgiest thing I will ever create.

**Nomad.** I’ve been dabbling in Psionics for 5e lately (see my take on a [Psion Class](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MPkCSxSj0OETiEd3Pyf)), and I thought the Nomad from the old UA: Mystic class would make for an interesting Ranger archetype. You’re focused on information gathering and teleportation. First draft, so I’m definitely open to feedback here.

**Spellbreaker.** One of my favorite subclasses I’ve created, this is what you play if you want to play a “mage hunter”. A popular character concept, but no dedicated archetype for it yet. I thought Ranger was the perfect fit. This one is pretty much finished and ready to play.

**Stargazer.** I’ve had this concept for a while, but the Circle of the Stars Druid in Tasha’s kinda stole my thunder. Looking to go in a different direction with this archetype and wondering what people think.

**Wrangler.** This one is the first draft and is probably really rough (I’m hesitant to even include it). I think the concept works well and sounds fun, but the mechanics could be a little messy so let me know what you think. Beast Master is the friend of animals, the Wrangler is dominating wild beasts and riding them in combat.

So, I’ve been thinking about playing an artificer recently for an upcoming game. I do like the class, but it’s the most recent addition and I was reflecting on how it has fewer subclasses than any others. I started musing about possible new subclasses, and well… this is the result.

For a brief description of the different subclasses:

* The Trapper – A somewhat Ranger-themed subclass, with a focus on crowd control and preparation. The damage it can deal is decent (pretty much equal to a Battle Smith), but its true draw is battlefield control – they have lots of options for restraining or inflicting conditions on enemies. It’s a bit unique because they have martial ranged weapon proficiency and the 5th level feature means that Trappers are just as effective using longbows as much as they are using cantrips.
* The Moonshiner – A counterpart to the Alchemist - while the Alchemist is focused on buffing the party, the Moonshiner has more of a skew towards debilitating the enemy. The damage is pretty meh, but it does gives some very unique options via drinking magical alcohol or throwing bottles at enemies. I also like the theme of brewing magical hard liquor instead of elixirs.
* The Toymaker – Not so good on damage, but a lot of utility. Toymakers learn 6 extra infusions and they can create lots of different toys (each one similar to the Homunculus Servant). Their biggest disadvantage is action economy; it takes a bonus action to command a toy to make an action, and they don’t have enough bonus actions to stack minion damage. Still, their toys can fulfill a lot of useful roles so they can pick and choose which ones to use.
* The Bombardier – This is meant to be a counterpart to the Artillerist. The damage that the Bombardier deals is near exactly the same as the Artillerist, which means it’s one of the highest damage dealing subclasses. It has lots of damage options but very little else – and its main drawback is that its Arcane Munitions require both an action and bonus action to fire, which greatly limits what else it can do. Still, it’s a very bursty class capable of lots of area of effects. An Artillerist will do higher continuous damage against a single target, but a Bombardier will have better burst damage against a group of enemies.
* The Siegemaster – This subclass is a strange one. I do like the concept, but I’m honestly not sure how it would play it out in a full game. The subclass is entirely defense focused; it can summon immobile barricades which give allies half cover, and your features are all about maintaining those barricades. A Siegemaster would do very badly charging into a group of enemies, but it would do very well defending against enemies charging against them.

150,gqsoqq0,m468sy,"Among the fiercest fighters in colonial militias, the ""ready in a minute"" men were handpicked from muster rolls for their patriotism, marksmanship, and physical strength. Expected to keep their arms with them at all times, Revolutionary minutemen were especially prevalent in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts after the occupation of Boston by the British Army in 1768. Demonstrations of military force inflamed tensions between the king's men and his subjects, and prior to the outbreak of hostilities incidents like the Powder Alarm in 1774 drove many to join the ranks of the minutemen. Of course, minutemen are most famous today for ""the shot heard round the world"" that began the Revolutionary War. Though their initial force was routed in a direct confrontation with the redcoats at Lexington, more minutemen quickly arrived as the British tried to disengage. The battle evolved into a running fight, culminating in a patriot victory at Concord Bridge.

On the other side, highlanders were among the most ardent loyalists who participated in the early actions of the war. Living mostly in rural areas of Georgia and the Carolinas, settlements of highland Scots immigrants remained somewhat insular and fiercely loyal to the crown. When war broke out, many highlanders volunteered to fight for the British governors in the south and their campaigns to recapture colonies in revolt. Though these provincial forces were poorly supplied and often had little to no ammunition, the highlanders were unquestionably brave and frequently engaged their enemies in hand-to-hand combat. At the Battle of Moore’s Creek Bridge in North Carolina, a contingent of broadsword-wielding Scotsmen attempted a highland charge against a superior force armed with muskets and rifles. They were repulsed by the patriot militias, and loyalist activity in the south was scattered for years until a second British offensive in 1778.

154,gqoh9ws,m3fmls,"So, yeah. This was not what I was supposed to be working on tonight. But what will be will be. If you have not seen it, the good folks over at WotC released a [new UA](https://media.wizards.com/2021/dnd/downloads/UA2021_FeyFolk.pdf) yesterday. Among what it offered was a Fairy, and said Fairy sparked much discussion in my general homebrew circles. Consequently, I decided to stay up too late revising it.

#### Summary & Changes:

* The size. I don't actually really care if they are small or tiny that much from a lore point of view, but I view the combination of Small and Fey Passage (and not listing the actual size) to be a combination of factors pointing out that it was, entirely, a cop out, rather than a lore based decision. It seems like they wanted them to be tiny, but didn't want to commit to a tiny sized race. So, I made them tiny and made a set of rules to make that more or less work.

* **Flight.** You can give them full flight if you allow that in your games. I don't, so I gave them a version of it I'd allow.

* **Subraces.** I wanted to give them more options. I like options. I knew that I needed a solution to make it so martials could play the race, but giving those features to all fairies didn't make a lot of sense. Sprites are militant little buggers, so that seems like a good enough solution. I'm sure more subraces could be added, but that seems like a problem for another day.

* **Fey Ancestry.** This is actually the one that started this whole little thing, as of all the things, this bugged me the most that literal fairies somehow lacked the Fey Ancestry trait :)

* **Stats.** Use the variant stat rules or not, no skin off my nose either way. Just providing a baseline stats for what I'd use for them without the variant rules.

* **Age.** I actually think it was fair enough they skipped this for fairies, though it seems pretty weird for the other ones. I just punted on this, I have no idea and in my mind fairies are true fey that just put into existence out of motes of rainbows in the feywild as fairies and never age as far as I'm concerned. I've never seen an old pixie. If they exist, I reckon it's cause the pixie thinks they are old, and bam, they old. Fey.

I want to head one thing off - I didn't write this to prove anything or to try to claim that their design is bad or anything. I had my own thoughts of how to tackle it, so I made my own version that I'll use, and cause I made it, I figured I'd share it. Part of why I wouldn't throw stones is I'm sure this a glass house - this is just a version I cooked up in the last few hours instead of doing more productive things I should be doing (the other part is cause you shouldn't throw stones... it's mean :D )

This is completely unrelated to most of what I make. In fact, I rarely make races in general. But you can find a few I've made before, like [the Hagkin](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-M65oAp8CUuuXAzTMLXG).

I'm currently playing a toy-maker/puppet master Battle Smith Artificer, so I wanted to take some of the core concepts of that subclass and apply it to a charisma-focused class like the bard. The subclass focuses around a combat puppet which is based off the Steel Defender, with several key differences, namely that the combat puppet has access to ""eldritch invocation"" style Puppet Performance Art which helps you customise your puppet to fit the needs of your play style and your group make up.Initially I made the subclass with the feature of choosing one of three puppets, each focused on combat, exploration or social interaction. but I decided the invocation-style format was worth exploring and dissected each puppet and split up their features.

* I decided to take out the Scout and Sniper subclasses. Sniper felt too much like a rogue thing, and Scout just wasn’t quite standing on its own conceptually. I also like the symmetry of having four revamped subclasses and four original subclasses.
* Changed the wording on Natural Healer and Roving to clarify some things a little.
* Added a little something extra to Feral Senses, making it feel more exciting for an 18th level feature and also cannibalizing a bit of the Scout.
* Threw in a note on multiclassing, even though the only difference from the PHB is herbalism kit proficiency, but it felt worth clarifying.
* Added boar and giant frog companions!
* Some minor fixes, mainly removing references to defunct features and a few typos.

This is the updated version of my previous take on a Hexgun. I divided the previous version into two -- the Hexgun as a subclass and the Pact of the Gun with accompanying invocations. Let me know what you think!

I tried to make the Hexgun stand out on its own rather than always being tied to the Pact of the Gun. The Hexgun's features focus on debuffing enemies -- similar to the College of Eloquence bard, but without the option of buffing your allies. The die you use to debuff is tied to your gun, initially being higher than the bard's inspiration die, but with the caveat that you need to HIT with the weapon, in addition to loading it and fixing it when it misfires (so it's not a straight buff). I could see playing the Hexgun with the Pact of the Tome as a really fun flavorful playstyle -- something akin to the Book of Eli.

Pact of the Gun is where you can make your warlock into an eldritch blaster with a gambling motif. The Witchgun Gambit invocation gambles your chance to cast a spell on being able to hit the enemy. Notice how the Pact of the Gun does not grant an extra attack at level 5 -- this is done intentionally to not completely outpace other party members in damage. Eldritch Blast scales in damage for you, and getting to attack with your weapon on top of that is already extra. Therefore, the purpose of the level 5 invocation is to improve your weapon attack by giving advantage to make sure you hit with it, the cost being your weapon misfires. I think this is a fair trade-off.

Let me know what you think of the class' balance. I think it's balanced, if not a little punishing. I think incorporating an increased misfire chance with each feature used during your turn may lead to increased bookkeeping and confusion, and I might just remove that motif altogether if others agree that I should.

I really liked the idea behind an arcane spellcaster mastering divine spells, similarly to the Divine Soul Sorcerer and Celestial Warlock. However, I never ever really liked the old School of Theurgy UA. All it really did was give you a Cleric subclass and in my opinion was done pretty lazily. I wanted to create a subclass that truly felt like someone who studies religion, rather than just being a Cleric subclass.

I decided that this kind of Wizard should have expertise with Religion, for obvious reasons. It's their primary area of study. I did like the idea from the original UA of choosing a Domain and getting something out of it, just not their implementation. I thought it could be a cool idea to be able to cast their 1st-level spells for free, with your time studying.

Lastly, the idea to summon an avatar of a myth or legend was something I loved the moment I thought of it, so I had to make it the capstone ability.

165,gqfuf6u,m1wlc0,"Third (and probably last) entry of the Gunslinger. I made a lot of changes to the class, specially to the Gunsmith. The most notable changes were:

* 13th and 17th levels are no longer empty.
* The Gunsmith is now a 1/3 Caster (used to be a Half Caster), the spellcasting now gets a few spell from the Artillerist (like the Eldritch Knight or Arcane Trickster get a few spell from any school of magic at 3rd, 8th, 14th and 20th level), you can now used a magic firearm as a spellcasting focus (like how the Artificer can use any Infusion as a spellcasting Focus) and almost every other feature from this trail was changed.
* The Scatter propertie and the carfting DC were simplified.
* Both Feats are now focused on either one-handed or two-handed firearms.
* Two firearms related items were added.

I was also unhappy with how the subclass didn't work with basic things such as opportunity attacks or booming blade.

As such I've written a variant of the subclass feature that solves these issues. Note that the variant gives the subclass a few minor buffs, the first being the blades working with these game mechanics, and the second being the off-hand attack dealing 1d6 instead of 1d4.

I hope this variant is helpful to you, if you feel the same way. I would love any feedback on wording/balance/other that you might have.

* Expend hit points in place of sorcery points (except in creating spell slots) to more freely utilize Metamagic and other features of the subclass.
* Infect yourself (and soon your enemies) with a disease that hurts and weakens its victims.
* Take damage to cure yourself of diseases... like the one in that last point! Fancy that!

I mostly just wanted to make the Touch the Mind invocation. This is because I thought it was stupid that the GoO never gets the ability to read thoughts. I consider it level appropriate because the Artificer gets the option of a free Helm of Telepathy at level 10, which is an item that's more powerful than this invocation.

Then I figured if I was going to do one, I may as well flesh the idea out a bit more. Eldritch Psionics is based on the Aberrant Mind level 6 psionic casting feature. Limited use per short rest and the additional bonus action cost seemed fair to me.

Couple of spell option invocations added in there; it's a sin that they're not available to warlocks already. Modify Memory and Geas just have such mind-witch warlock vibes.

With 4 revamped subclasses, I hope this fourth showing can let all of you wonderful people have an additional chance to do some playtesting!

\-  Added Ward-Powered Weave to the Aegis of the Weave to give it a stronger start. It was previously the weakest vanguard subclass.

\-  Added the ability to re-enter your unnatural shift to Aegis of the Blur. Fixed the capstone to account for this.

\-  Redid the formatting of the Aegis of the Light and Blur (pretty much swapped them to better showcase their art).

\-  Made all of the Aegises in alphabetical order! It’s a proper class now!

**Oath of Beauty.** Elegance, vanity, otherworldly good looks; how will you use your divinely gifted good looks to influence those around you? The first pass at a self-obsessed paladin, definitely interested in feedback on the mechanics. I like the flavor, but the mechanics may need some fine-tuning.

**Oath of the Blade.** A bit of a mechanical experiment with the Paladin here, I’ve cut a Channel Divinity and half of the Oath Spells to give this Paladin limited Maneuvers from the Battle Master. Very interested in feedback on this first draft!

**Oath of the Corsair.** One of my most popular homebrew subclasses, the Oath of the Corsair returns with new art, spelling/grammar corrections, and clarified ability descriptions.

**Oath of Inquisition.** A utilitarian seeker of truth, nobody will expect you (*lack of expectation not guaranteed upon swearing this oath*).

**Oath of Liberty.** The former Oath of Solidarity returns with a new coat of paint, a better theme, clarified abilities, and some sick artwork from MTG.

187,gq7n320,m0gm2p,"*In Colonial America, a portage was a place of transit between two nearby rivers. Used extensively by trailblazers and especially Canadien fur traders and voyageurs, portage allowed adventurers to use the rivers of the interior as a highway system to venture deep into uncharted territory. Key portage points connecting the St. Lawrence, Ohio, and Mississippi to other waterways became important strategic locations, and European settlements and forts quickly grew around them. The modern cities of Montreal, St. Louis, Chicago, Albany, Wheeling, Baton Rouge, and many more originated at portages.*

*Floating log boons consisting of hundreds of logs were used to transport timber, a vital resource for construction and shipbuilding, along rivers as well. Though they had their origins in commercial logging operations, some “logjams” could effectively block a waterway. The Great Raft was a natural logjam in Louisiana formed of dead and decaying trees that extended for 160 miles and cut off access to the Red and Atchafalaya rivers. In a pinch, a logjam could be used as an improvised chevaux-de-frise to deny access to enemy boats. During the Revolutionary War, a logjam was used at the second Battle of Machias to set a trap for a party of British marines.*

The *Nations & Cannons* campaign setting is based on historical events. In this mundane world, **gambits**—stunts of guile, misdirection, or trickery—take the place of spells. These gambits are available for the Ranger and new [Firebrand](https://www.reddit.com/r/NationsAndCannons/comments/hwju8z/the_firebrand_class_for_agents_and_provocateurs/) class, but they could be added to any other caster’s spell list.

In this update I have changed the edict system to be a bit for exiting, and interactive, a lot of the edict were really static like “you can take dash action as a bonus action” pretty boring, so now all the edicts rely on an Edict Die which increases in size as you get more levels.

Also beginning from the next version I want to start making more subclasses and fill out the roster, and would like to hear what you would like to see, so I have made a strawpoll where you can vote.

The Complete Guide to Sanctum is a project I started a year ago. The project focuses on bringing a new setting sourcebook akin to Eberron and Ravnica, including new lore, new races/subraces, a new class, new subclasses, new feats, new backgrounds, new spells, new creatures: basically a full extension on base 5e. Currently, it is around 40% complete. Large sections of it are mapped out but I still have lots of work to do before I am finished. I'll be sharing content here whenever I can. Want to know more about the project?

197,gq11bzk,lzcm6e,"Hello everyone! This is my first post in what I plan to be a series of monster redesigns. This one, as you can tell, is for the werewolf. The Monster Manual makes the human and hybrd forms of a werewolf share the same stat block. When a werewolf transforms into its hybrid form, it should immensely increase in power. However, when using the MM version, this only adds bite and claw attacks, because the human form already had the werewolf's damage immumities, ability scores, and other stats.

However, with this variant, the humanoid and hybrid forms are seperate stat blocks. In addition, the cursed humanoid has much less freedom over when they transform, and have no control over themselves while in their werewolf form.

The product of my desire for more investigative magic, Glimpse Death is perfect for a particularly inquisitive wizard, a cleric trying to keep order in a lawless town, or a necromancer knowledgeable in their field of expertise. There's plenty of opportunity for roleplay with this spell, especially if you're casting it at higher levels.

I _really_ like the new Swarmkeeper Ranger subclass. The features are so creative and flavorful! However, by far the coolest feature is ""Swarming Dispersal"" which Swarmkeepers get at 15th level.

But... what if I want to do the same thing but earlier! Waiting until 15th level could take a really long time. So, I created this spell to give Druids and Rangers a taste of the ability.

I'm still working on balancing spells, so feedback welcome. I feel like this spell is a mix between *blur* and *misty step*, with an all-or-nothing check and no scaling, so I think this is the right level but welcome thoughts. :)

Another sneak preview from ***Hippocamper's Complete Cookbook -*** an expansive menu of character options, magic items, and DM tools with fantastical cooking as its primary theme. The Cookbook is focused around my [Gourmet class](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/l8mcst/the_gourmet_v4_final_spice_up_your_adventures/), but also includes details on a diversely themed set of 'table guests', such as this new chin-stroking wizard. I've been working closely on a lot of spells this week for the compendium, and frankly been lax on posting, so I thought I'd kick off a 'Wizardly Week' of magical previews with this subclass, since spells are on the brain.

Several options in the Cookbook take a sideways run at psychic flavour. I'm not brave enough for psionics in full, but I think mentally-influenced characters have so much fun potential. This arcane tradition combines this already possibly-controversial thematic thrust with a controversial mechancial one: **double concentration!** But not for you, no no, that would be broken, whereas this... is... balanced? At least, I think it can be: please wrack your brain over every way possible you can pierce this concept and deflate my ego. Every iteration I can make is a better one.

As ever, I'm very interested in any feedback on the subclass, as I hope to keep improving everything I can in the Cookbook to a high standard before I finally lay down my keyboard.

I’ve always felt that the Fighter lacked interesting options in combat, but wasn’t necessarily underpowered. The Alternate Fighter is a reimagining of the class that includes Maneuvers as part of the base Fighter class. I am always open to constructive feedback.

I’ve also split the project into two documents:

* The Alternate Fighter (this post): full class, most thematic martial archetypes.

* Alternate Fighter: Expanded (needs playtesting): more Fighting Styles, Maneuvers, stranger Martial Archetypes, and Alternate rules for the officially published Martial Archetypes!

# Change Log

**Alternate Fighter v1.2.0**

* Fighter Table - Added Superiority Dice and Superiority die size

* Fighting Style - Added Superior Technique

* Combat Superiority - Superiority dice now scale by Fighter level

* Maneuvers - Added Feinting Attack, Parry, and Riposte back to the list of maneuvers available to all fighter archetypes.

* Ability Score Improvement - Removed extra 6th level ASI.

* Action Surge - Moved to 6th level.

* Arcane Knight / Spellcasting - Fixed Spells Known to match other quarter-casters.

* Arcane Knight / War Magic - You can cast a cantrip in place of an attack when you take the Attack action.

* Arcane Knight / Improved War Magic - You can cast an arcane knight spell in place of an attack when you take the Attack action.

* Arcane Knight / Arcane Smite - Damage reduced a bit to compensate for at-will magic force damage.

* Commander / Rallying Cry - Commander’s Strike grants temp hit points equal to fighter level.

* Commander / Inspiring Commands - Creatures targeted by a maneuver have advantage on their next roll

* Blade Master - Renamed to Swordsage

* Guardian - Adjusted the 3rd level ability for clarity.

* Guerrilla - Moved to “Alternate Fighter Expanded”. I just didn’t think this made the cut for “classic fighter archetype” like the others I included with the Alternate Fighter.

* Quartermaster - Moved to “Alternate Fighter Expanded”.

* Spellshot - renamed to Alternate Arcane Archer and moved to “Alternate Fighter Expanded”

* Swordsage - (new?) archetype a combination of the PHB Battle Master and the Bladesinger. Why should wizards have a better swordsman archetype than the fighter?!

**Alternate Fighter Expanded v1.2.0**

* New Fighting Styles and Maneuvers! These are a little out-there and 100% need playtesting.

* Guerrilla / By Land or Sea - no disadvantage for underwater attacks. Added a third option for in-combat mobility on land.

* Pact Warrior - new archetype!

* Tinker Knight - new archetype!

* Alternate Cavalier - clarified and added Cavalier Maneuvers.

* Alternate Samurai - added Samurai Maneuvers

* Alternate Arcane Archer - clarified and balanced. Added Divining Shot and Piercing Shot back.

* Alternate Echo Knight - new archetype with new Echo Knight Maneuvers!

* Alternate Psi Warrior - clarified and added Psi Warrior Maneuvers.

* Alternate Rune Knight - Renamed/added new maneuvers.

210,gpzdcph,lyfven,"Luckily I've got answers! I'm glad you like the Alternate Fighter!

* To compensate for adding Maneuvers to the base class (a fairly powerful feature comparable to low-level spellcasting IMO), some things needed to be adjusted. The PHB Fighter isn't underpowered (I won't get into linear Fighter / quadratic Wizard here), so some things needed to be moved around. I personally don't think ASI's were ""core"" to the Fighter, so those got cut. Action Surge is a cool ability, but *something* needed to be moved back. 

* Maybe one day I will attempt a full-on ""spellsword"" (aka Arcane Half-Caster), but until then, the Arcane Knight should do the trick!

* Those are the non-copyright infringing versions of *armor of agathys* and *aganazzar's scorcher*. They aren't in the free-to-use (SRD) version of D&D 5e.

* You might want to check out my Pact Warrior archetype in the companion to this - [Alternate Fighter: Expanded](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MUkP55cdNMTFYMKlDUL)

* There is also an Alternate Arcane Archer in the [Alternate Fighter: Expanded](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MUkP55cdNMTFYMKlDUL)

* Good catch on the typo!

* Definitely inspired from there, I didn't realize I kept the same name. The Marksman is basically a combination of the MM: Gunslinger, UA: Sharpshooter, ToB: Renegade, and my own strange homebrew mind.

* The Swordsage ended up becoming a combination of the Battle Master, Bladesinger, and College of Swords Bard. I thought being able to learn *any* manevuer (similar to a Bard's Magical Secrets) was flavorful for a true master of the blade! It used to have Parry, Precision Attack, and Riposte as archetype manevuers, but it felt weird not letting other Fighters learn those (IMO basic) swordplay maneuvers.

I have been working over the past few months on a lot of content. Too much, some might say (including myself at times). The reason for this is because I have been working diligently on a massive project: my own setting guide. This setting, known as **Yvarra**, has been the primary setting for my home games for years and I am excited to announce that I am making a complete guide for it. This guide, known as **Yorviing’s Guide to Yvarra** will feature a brand new setting filled with [strange and unusual gods and demigods](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MGQEKDQ9U67Wtw7Ql0A), forgotten and ancient magic, and terrifying creatures that lurk in the dark. This setting book will aim to give both players and GMs alike with a wealth of options to run campaigns and stories within Yvarra, and I hope to release a preview of the project soon!

Today I decided to show off one of the cleric subclasses that is going into YGY after being revised and altered. Today’s subclass, **Arcane Tradition: Pyromancy**, is a subclass focused on wielding and mastering the art of flame. To pyromancers, fire is not just a tool for destruction; fire symbolizes rebirth, purity, divinity, and the spark of life.   

I decided to keep the artwork a bit more simple on this one too, to make it just easier to understand (and also not super edgy)

I hope you are all having a great day, and I hope that everyone enjoys this new subclass — **Arcane Tradition: Pyromancy (Revised)** :D

Hello, everyone! This is the first public release of my version of the Crusader! It's taken me a long time to work through all the mechanics and balance them, but I finally got the support and motivation required to finish it up for release.

This is a complete adaptation and 5e conversion of the Crusader class from D&D 3.5e's Tome of Battle: The Book of Nine Swords. The Crusader includes the maneuver mechanics that fans of the original ToB should be able to appreciate, which brings some much-needed complexity and depth to a martial class for 5th edition. My class includes all 20 levels of the Crusader, 4 subclasses, the complete maneuver rules, over 90 unique maneuvers adapted and balanced for 5e, and tons of flavor and content from the Tome of Battle.

This Crusader adaptation was designed and balanced for 5e by myself, but I received plenty of help along the way from the lovely people over on the [Haven Discord](https://discord.gg/qEjJuMx) server.

219,gpnlvck,lxlj81,"DESIGNER NOTES:   


The Adaptive Being is a monster that I thought of after watching the second season of *One Punch Man*, as Garou adapts to and mimics the fighting styles of his enemies. As I worked on it, it also took on inspiration from other villains in fiction like Meruem (HxH), Perfect Cell (DBZ), and Doomsday (DC Comics).   


It starts as a very weak creature for its CR, but its abilities allow it to copy almost every feature that your party can muster, and its ability scores increase with every turn it is allowed to stay alive. It's Undying feature is intended to give it a bit of a buffer against the sorts of ""one-turn-novas"" that are not uncommon in party's around level 10. This way it can stand a fighting chance and the party can at least see what the creature combat is about.  


The ""Adaptive Being Tactics"" section on the second page covers most of my thoughts on how to introduce an adaptive being in your campaign, but I should also give a few examples as to who could be creating a being and for what purposes. I could imagine a powerful wizard or lich creating one to serve as a new body for itself, or perhaps as a Frankensteinian show of genius (""I've created the perfect being!""). A doomsday cult or even a well-intentioned clerical circle could create it as a host body to their existing God, or perhaps they believe they were destined to bring life to a new God. A warlord could commission artificers and mages to create the perfect soldiers in preparation for a coming war, overestimating the Adaptive Being's ability to be controlled.

**Changelog v3 -> v3.1**

A smaller update this time, focusing on correcting some of the last few issues people pointed out.

* The most significant change is the removal of Weapon Talent and subsequent repositioning of Natural Healer to 2nd level. Hunted Shot was a cool idea but it’s just a bit too strong, and the rest of Weapon Talent really just existed to match it. With Natural Healer moved to level 2, level 3 is now a little less crowded. Crossbow Ace has been folded into the Sniper archetype.
* I’ve changed Roving to not give climbing and swimming speeds equal to your walking speed. This is to fit better with Favored Terrain Master for Coast, Mountain and Forest - now these bring your swimming/climbing speeds up to parity, since it was a little silly to be able to climb or swim *faster* than you could run. It also means that Grassland and other walking speed boosts don’t raise your swimming and climbing speed as well. Grassland has also been brought down to a 5 foot boost to walking speed, because you’re getting enough from Roving.
* Monster Slayer has a new 3rd level feature, Monster Expert, instead of Mental Fortitude, which was a little strong and a little redundant with Iron Mind. The skill boosts feel like a logical and flavorful addition.
* Minor typo/grammar fixes.

That’s it! With these changes I think the class is just about ready for play, though feedback is still appreciated.

- 6 School of Magic subclasses
- 8 all-new Backgrounds
- Equipment and currency straight from the series
- 60+ potions brewed by combining 90+ ingredients, with a custom-designed crafting mechanic
- Magical pets as mini-familiars
- 14 new Feats
- 140+ custom Harry Potter spells, with a conversion guide to 5e equivalents

There's an accompanying Monster Book of Monsters (currently a work-in-progress) to provide custom stat blocks for all of the fantastic beasts you'll run into. I've also started a Headmaster's Guide, which is still in its early stages. It's going to be filled with:

- Setting information to give you the cliff's notes of the Wizarding World
- Variant rules to allow for different interpretations of the Harry Potter setting
- Magical treasure to reward your players
- Details on downtime activities at Hogwarts and ways to run Quidditch
- Location guides of Hogwarts, Hogsmeade, and Diagon Alley, complete with inventories and NPCs

Hey everybody! I know that last time I said I was thinking of posting other homebrew content here that wasn't subclass related, but I just loved this idea so much that I knew that I had to post it next. I know the idea that a swarm of vermin as a patron might be a bit weird to most, but I really love the idea of having warlock patrons that aren't always super powerful entities that have existed for who knows how long and are also probably imprisoned in super jail located in some forgotten part of reality. Now the point of this subclass is to essentially be the dedicated companion subclass for warlock. I know that with that description it seems like this subclass would basically require you to run pact of the chain, but I did my best to design it in a way where you could run any pact with this subclass and it would play just as well as if you had picked chain. In the end I had a blast designing this subclass, so lets look over its features!

Expanded Spell Lists: Now since the theme of this subclass was vermin and other such pest, I thought it would be appropriate to include spells relating to beasts. So options like beast bond, dominate beast, giant insect, and insect plague were must have inclusions. When it comes to Pass Without Trace and Nondetection, I added them in because they represent how infestations (which are caused by vermin like rats or snakes) often go unnoticed until they are right in your face. So what better way to represent such a thing then with these spells? As for Contagion,  rats spread the bubonic plague through the fleas they carried. So it seemed appropriate to give this warlock a spell to spread their own disease.

Pest Control: The main focus of this entire subclass, this feature gives you control over you very own horde of little vermin! Controlling it works similar to other companion subclasses, though I made it a bonus action so that way it could free the player up to do a bit more by retaining their action. As for the design of the unique companion itself, I wanted to make it so that it would scale well with the player while retaining the weakness of being fragile so as to balance out its other strengths. I went about doing this by giving it AC that caps out at 15 AC at later levels, making it relatively easy to hit throughout the entire game, as well make it unable to regain hit points or gain temp hit points. Now since I wanted to differentiate this subclass from its contemporaries, I gave it the unique ability to split into two separate hordes that you can control at the cost of making the horde smaller, do less damage, and have less health. I decided to put this ability on recharge to encourage the player to think critically on when to use it.

Vigilant Varmint: First off I just wanted to say that I love this feature's name. Anyway, my intention with this feature was to create a protective option that players can use to defend themselves when need be. So here when you are under attack by a hostile creature while within 5 feet of your horde, you can use your reaction to command the horde to protect you. Now since this feature can be really powerful by denying damage, I decided there need to be some serious drawbacks. Thus when your horde takes an attack for you it hits regardless (i.e. nothing can stop the attack from hitting it), it takes the full damage of the class (i.e. nothing can reduce the damage), and if it is reduced to zero hit point with damage left over, you take the rest of the damage. And I also limited to 3 uses per long rest as I felt any other method (such as tying it to proficiency or a stat modifier) would make it too spammable which is what I wanted to avoid.

Rushing Horde: This feature exists simply as a fun way to mess with you enemies. And because the idea of someone getting run over by a horde of rats is funny to me.

Vermin Onslaught: This feature is meant as a way for you to focus down a particular enemy with your horde. Off course the trade off is that you can't do much with your horde once they are focusing on that particular enemy. I also made it a long rest recharge ability so that way if you have two hordes up you can't command both to do this on two separate creatures, as that would just be ridiculous.

Swarm of the Century: The capstone of the entire subclass, it essentially exists to make your horde bigger and deadlier. I added the double damage to building and structures part because infestations of certain vermin/pests can do some serious structural damage to building irl. And the other part of this feature is that it allows you to split the horde into three separate groups instead of just two, allowing you to have even more fun. The rules of how this works doesn't change all too much from how it does with two, except now they each have less hit points so as to balance out the fact that you have three separate entities that you can control.

&#x200B;

Originally appearing  in the SCAG, Oath of the Crown was actually one of the stronger subclasses in that book, which means its still arguably the weakest paladin subclass. I've actually been playing a Crown paladin for the past few months, and its definitely stronger than people give it credit for, but aside from Champion's Challenge and Spirit Guardians, the subclass doesn't get much and, what they do get, other subclasses can do  better (\*cough\* oath of redemption \*cough\*). Personally, nothing excited me aside from those two things about this subclass so I decided to try reworking it into something more effective but also distinct among the other paladin subclasses.

&#x200B;

With this rework, I've tried to lean into the Crown paladin's design as a MMO style tank who draws aggro while also being a commander type character who can lead armies or  their party into battle.

&#x200B;

**Changes:**

\- Oath spells have been changed to be more useful and to have more spells that aren't already on the Paladins spell list (hold monster, hold person, healing word, and mass healing word)

\-Turn the Tide, an ability that is almost never useful in play, has been replaced with Divine Leadership, boosting the Crown paladins ability as a face, fitting with the commander and law enforcer themes of the subclass.

\-Divine Allegiance is literally just a worse version of the Redemption's Aura of the Guardian, so this obviously had to change. Instead of merely giving both subclass the same ability, however, I changed it to Aura of the Champion, something more in line with other MMO tank style subclasses (ancestral guardian, cavalier)

\-Unyielding Spirit is boring and barely useful, so Unwavering Resolve replaces it, giving a more exciting and more broadly applicable benefit while fitting more with the commander and guardian theme of the class

\-Exalted Champion is pretty boring for a 20th level paladin transformation, so I buffed up the resistances and gave a free 1/turn 1st level smite to the paladin and the whole party. In exchange, the duration has been nerfed and the death save advantage is gone (whose dying from death saves at 20th level anyways??)

Personally, I think this is the most difficult class to come up with subclasses for (since the flavor of a Monk is fairly narrow in comparison with the other official classes). As always, I welcome constructive feedback, especially for the two new subclasses I’m posting for the first time: Way of the Vigilante and Way of the Void.

# Monastic Traditions

**Way of the Boulder.** *(Cue Avatar References!)* This is my take on a sumo/kung-fu panda/beefy monk. Where a normal monk wants Dex, Wis, then Con, the Way of the Boulder switches the paces of Con/Dex. I think the reduction to Unarmored Movement balances it out. Monk also isn’t the strongest class in the book, so some tiny buffs won’t hurt.

**Way of the Sacred Inks.** My take on what is *,in my opinion,* a big missing archetype in the Monk class. They lend themselves so well to divine concepts! The flavor on this one is a little narrow (with sacred tattoos), but I think it's a really neat idea for a Monk. Their 3rd level Divine Conduit features are fairly strong, but you can only have one “active” at a time.

**Way of the Vigilante.** This one is a bit silly, but I think I’ve justified the concept with the flavor text. Super Heroes are huge in pop culture right now, so I wanted a way to build a Monk/Super Hero (their class features work really well for it). Spider-Man, Daredevil, etc (Batman??) could all be built as Monks. This is the first draft, so I’m open to feedback.

**Way of the Void.** I designed this to be a counterpart to the College of Creation in Tasha’s (that’s what the 3rd level ability is based on). This Tradition might make for a better villain than a hero. Again, another first draft, so looking for feedback on this one. I like the flavor, but the mechanics may need some tweaking.

**Way of the Wilds.** A Monk subclass for all the monstrous/beast races we have in 5e! Obviously, it isn’t exclusive to them (though in my games it would be). I’ve shared this one before and done a little streamlining. The goal is to have the features at 3rd and 17th level be equal in power, what do you think?

Hello all! Here's the product of my efforts in the Homebrewery. Here we have the Demon Fox, a monster based on the various Fox Spirits common in East Asian legend. Hopefully it'll be a fine addition to any DM hoping to run something in Kara-Tur, or any other East Asian setting. I designed this monster as something that could be the ""boss"" of a Lv 5 one shot or side quest in a campaign. I made a note of enthralled mortals and ghouls as potential minions for the Demon Fox. Ghouls in particular could make an encounter particularly nasty, since their paralyzing touch would leave PCs vulnerable to the Demon Fox's *Feed* action.   


I wrote the description to fit the lore of my homebrew world, so feel free to pay it no mind if you'd like to incorporate this monster in your own world.   


C&C is definitely appreciated! I'm still relatively new to homebrewing content and creating thins in the Homebrewery, so any feedback would be fantastic.

It's been awhile since I posted a piece of the crafting system, but here's a new piece: Leatherworking!

Leatherworking might seem like a less glamorous branch than Blacksmithing or Enchanting at first glance, but I think it's actually the crafting system that has been used the most in my current game (granted its a bit more survival oriented and not not necessarily typical :D )

For those that haven't encountered my crafting system, let me offer an Introduction:

## Crafting Intro!

### Why do you need Crafting?
Some people may wonder - why do you need a crafting system? Isn't that what loot is for? The truth is, in some games, that's true. Not every adventurer is going to want to pursue crafting. But with a crafting system, not only can you craft what you need without finding it in a dragon hoard, what you find in that dragon hoard can be so much more.

In a game with a robust crafting system, there is no junk, there is just more opportunities and fresh possibilities. A +1 shortsword that no one can use could be the valuable basis of a new spear. Gems, gold, relics, and recyclables... all valid entry points for the crafters creativity. 

Adventurers are inherently innovative folks on a quest for creative solutions to difficult problems. Crafting gives them that toolbox.

So... why do you need crafting? You don't. But you should probably want it.

### A Player Driven System
One of the fundamental goals and inspirations of the crafting system is to make it a player driven system. It is a system where the player can say ""**I** would like to harvest the monster for ingredients"" and ""**I** would like to forage as we go through the forest looking for alchemy reagents"" and ultimately ""**I** would like to make a healing potion"" and all those rules can be exposed in a PHB like style to the player. The DM still adjudicates many instances of them, but the ideal is to have a system in which the DM does not have to handcraft every instance of gathering materials and crafting.

### Hooking Your Players In
On the other hand, if the DM wants to get the players into it, there are some tools they can use. By far the most effective tool is to give the players reagents as part of loot that don't have an obvious place to sell them. If you give players 2 curative reagents, they are going to start looking into how they can use those, as they'd much rather have a healing potion.

If you want to go one further though, if you give them *5* curative reagents and they realize they will have a remainder of one... then they start looking into ""Well, how do we get a 6th!""

### Generic Ingredients
Above and throughout the document, you will see that ingredients are referred to by generic tags like ""common curative reagent"" rather than specific natures. For example, you may harvest magical herbs, and find Kingsbane in the forest, a poisonous plant. For the purposes of crafting, this can be recorded simply as a ""common poisonous reagent"" and used as such in crafting. 

This greatly simplifies the process of crafting and recording what your supplies are. Narratively speaking, a skilled alchemist can render down the ingredients they want to use in the form they need.

Each crafting profession will have some profession wide materials that are used in their recipes - reagents for alchemy, metals for blacksmithing, etc. 

Some very rare and legendary items will have specific ingredients; this is for flavor rather than balance, though is up to your DM.

### Camp Actions

A recommended complimentary system is the Kibbles Camp Actions which can be found [**here**](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MK0g94rlPq9A0KprEKC) and provide more formalized rules for how to make use of your time during a long rest.

252,gp49gkn,lu51n2,"Hey everyone! A few weeks back I posted the [Way of the Cloud Walker](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/ku9lz1/monk_way_of_the_cloud_walker_embody_the_power_of/) monk. One of the major bits of feedback I got was that it was underpowered, so I tried going a bit more on the powerful side with this one. There's a few things I want to address before I get comments about them:

Four Elements Monk is quite oppressive in its flavour, ruling out much of the more specific elemental monk archetypes. But the mechanics for Four Elements are also really underwhelming to the point that it's probably my least favourite subclass in all of 5e, despite the flavour being awesome. One of the ways I reckon this can be fixed is to instead develop more specific elemental monks that really lean into the flavour. Way of the Flowing River tries to bring in some of those ideas without using the same things as Four Elements.

I consider this subclass similar to the Drakewarden Ranger, where it's flavour is quite similar to Beast Master but they offer different things. I also don't plan to make another elemental monk at this stage (that can always change).

As usual, any feedback is appreciated!

The Complete Guide to Sanctum is a project I started a year ago. The project focuses on bringing a new setting sourcebook akin to Eberron and Ravnica, including new lore, new races/subraces, a new class, new subclasses, new feats, new backgrounds, new spells, new creatures: basically a full extension on base 5e. Currently, it is around 40% complete. Large sections of it are mapped out but I still have lots of work to do before I am finished. I'll be sharing content here whenever I can. Want to know more about the project?

So I have made a lot of changes since the last version, the name has changed to stop the people that keeping reading it as bonder, but it is also closer to my Soul Binder while still being different. There have been made big changes to the companion creation, that should be more streamline while still allowing you to make the perfect companion for you. Here is the changelog:

* Wording and grammar fixes
* Removed alot unnecessary wording from ""Bonded Companion""
* Added Bond to the Wild to also be able to make a Monstrosity companion
* Fixed HP scaling on the ""Resilient"" HP type
* Added features that was missing from the class table
* Moved Soul Shield from 11th to 10th level.
* Renamed Bond to the Far Realms to Bond to the Unknown
* Added to Bond to the Unknown so it can also be a fiend.
* Changed the companion creation to use archetypes to reduce the amount of step and make it easier while still having alot of customizability.
* Moved ""Resting Voice"" from 9th level to 11th level.
* Removed the ""Companion Recall"" spell as it wasn't useful anymore.
* Added the ""Soul Mark Slash"" cantrips
* Changed Edicts to be activated as a bonus action
* Added to ""Keen Guidance"" that if you use action to command your companion you can use bonus action to make an attack or cast a cantrip.
* Added the ""Soul Mark Slash"" cantrip
* Bond of the Unknown ""Otherworldly Grasp"" now recharges after a short or long rest
* Renamed the class to ""Soul Linker"" so it is closer to Soul Binder but still different. Also changed the name of alot of features.
* Changed the 7th level feature of ""Link to the Wild"" to be more interactive and synergistic.
* Lowered the starting damage from ""Link to the Dragonkin""´s Magic Infused Breath to 3d8 from 4d8 (scales the same way)

Hello [r/unearthedarcana](https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/)! This is the third public version of The Vanguard (previously known as the warden). The Vanguard is a defence-focused class based around creating martial wards. With 4 reworked subclasses, I hope this third showing can let all of you wonderful people have a chance to do some playtesting! Lemme know if it seems under/overpowered, or just needs tweaking in general. There have been only a few tweaks since its last iteration, so I believe it is fairly balanced overall.

**Change Log:**

\- Meditative Rest has been updated to improve scaling.

\- Changed starting gear from:

* \- (a) three martial weapons
* \- (a) a shield or (b) any simple melee weapon
* \- (a) chain mail or (b) leather, longbow, and 20 arrows
* \- An explorer's pack and a net.

TO

* \- (a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons
* \- (a) splint or (b) studded leather, longbow, and 20 arrows
* \- An explorer's pack and 5 sticks of incense.

To reinforce the defensive and meditative themes of this class. Many people wanted the class to be a d12 hit die, but I don’t think its high AC potential justifies a ton of health, so I just gave it a higher starting AC to help that. I personally don’t feel that splint (or studded leather) at level 1 is crazy.

\- Changed Healthy Ward to scale better, and no longer undermine proper healers. Also toned down Improved Healthy Ward by removing double heal.

\- Fixed the wording on many features for better readability. Also fixed the formatting of a few blocks of text to look nicer.",UnearthedArcana,The Vanguard V1.3! - An Aura-based Defensive Martial Class! Unlock The Shield Within You With The Power Of Wards!

282,gocdlcc,lpphds,"The colonial wars of North America were fought on unfamiliar battlefields for the British, French, and Spanish empires. The vast forests of the interior led to a new breed of warfare, where skirmishers and light infantry could turn the tide of an engagement. While European military tactics were organized around mass volleys, individual marksmanship became increasingly important in the colonies. With the development of the longrifle, American sharpshooters—known despairingly as “widow makers” by the redcoats—were among the most effective soldiers in the Continental Army. Units like Morgan’s Riflemen were the bane of the British army, picking off enemy officers one-by-one at incredible range…

The Marksman is a highly customizable subclass that gains additional Techniques as they level up. Based off their Intelligence modifier, these techniques give a Rogue limited-use special abilities for a variety of different tactical options. Many techniques grant access to gambits (mundane spells) such as trick shots, spycraft, or other traps. Some give additional benefits when firing artillery or other types of weapons. Others have special effects and debuffs that can be activated by *forgoing* Sneak Attack damage—lessening the Marksman’s damage output for a round, but giving them the ability to control the battlefield and outwit their enemies.

This writeup also includes weapon stats (and basic rules for Artillery). Because guns are prevalent in the setting, all firearms are grouped as either martial or simple weapons and don't need a special proficiency. Some weapons here like the golcher rifle or amusette rifle are intended to take the place of magic items... instead of something like a ""flaming"" musket with +1d6 fire damage, these are rarer, finely crafted firearms with higher base damage.

All these guns are muzzle-loaded firearms, meaning nearly all have the ""reload 1"" trait and take an action to reload. The base damage is therefore very high—it averages out to about normal damage over 2 rounds—but this does mean that ""burst damage"" out of the gate is pretty high. Combat changes pretty fundamentally and obviously cover becomes more important.

*This version of Marksman has significantly overhauled and rebalanced Techniques, including the all-new Cannoneer, Gut Shot, and Blinding Charge. Class abilities at level 9 and 17 have been completely reworked in light of the new Cunning Aim alternate feature from Tasha’s Guide to Everything. Several gambits have been revised for clarity and sidebars added to explain some additional effects.*

283,gok1ppt,lpryvr,"Hello everyone again! After a longer than I wanted break I've returned to get some more of the awesome advice and input from this fabulous community!

I've been working on a series of subclasses with the core concept being to translate some ideas from my favorite Playstation game Legend of Dragoon into DnD. I've also been using this as an excuse to get more familiar with classes and subclasses as I am still pretty new to DnD (2 years) and DMing (1 year).

With that short intro out of the way; here is what I have so far. Please feel encouraged to dissect and give critique as I like what I've done but I'm afraid I still don't have the experience to know if things are too OP or underpowered or would go against the core of what the classes SHOULD be.

[https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MUHWHmvsuH-o7Bt\_oKR](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MUHWHmvsuH-o7Bt_oKR) \- Ranger subclass that focuses mostly on buffing allies and imposing conditions on enemies with a bit of area control mixed in.

[https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MUGP0xjvot8H9JJ8Jvr](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MUGP0xjvot8H9JJ8Jvr) \- Fighter subclass that focuses on taking what Fighters do best, deal damage, and ups it even more. Augments attacks with fire and gives options to close to melee even faster. I'm considering making the earlier level abilities more like the 18th level one in terms of high risk, high reward factor but I'm not sure if that would be frustrating or overly complicate things.

[https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MNRanvQHvdfa4ypjXWB](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MNRanvQHvdfa4ypjXWB) \- Paladin subclass that focuses on healing and gives Paladins the option of focusing on being ranged/using their touch healing and buff spells at range. I don't know why but this subclass makes me particularly proud but I'm not sure on the ""Heaven's Gate"" ability as of right now.

[https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MMQw9X9GNi05AgX6s8h](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MMQw9X9GNi05AgX6s8h) \- Barbarian subclass that looks to give Barbarians some magical range options and crowd control. Gives some opportunity to deal more damage more often.

&#x200B;

I'm still working on 3 more subclasses and if anybody has any ideas for them I'd love to hear them also.

Bard Subclass - going to be based on the Blue-Sea Dragoon. I'm thinking a focus on mobility since that matches the way the character plays in the game, maybe centered around placing anchors around the map that allow the character to teleport or create watery barriers? I'm thinking a combo of map control and mobility.

Rogue Subclass - going to be based on the Dark Dragoon. Not entirely sure on the concept yet besides it having features that allow you to leech life, work in shadows and/or banish creatures temporarily. Still researching how Rogues work.

Monk (?) Subclass - going to be based on the Violet Dragoon. I have no idea what I'm doing here. Does SP conflict with Ki too much? Is this the right class for this? I'd love some input on this one.

284,gon7sdw,lpryvr,"I've been juggling an idea for a meal system in DnD. I've tried to reach out in this subreddit and 2 others for help but it just doesn't seem to be a popular idea. For review of it click [here](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/UfUfbRF4hLvV).

It's still a Work In Progress and I feel hesitant to continue without some feedback. I would rather have to rewrite 2 pages worth of content than 5 pages worth of content.

To give some perspective here's what I would plan on adding next:

* A vegetable and fruit list that a player will choose to include regularly for some light buffs. Like, eating a lot of carrots to get advantage on Perception checks that rely on sight.
* A better explanation of what an ""extra meal"" is and what it does. For example, giving extra meals an heal equal to half your proficiency bonus.
* Include alternatives for each food group or how stuff can be replaced. For example how a vegetarian can still include protein portions.
* Improve the balancing of dietary goals, like taking into consideration how they might overlap with each other, which is an intended feature but must be properly balanced.

The principle idea here was to add another way for a character to define itself, since I think the different diets considered would have a real impact on differentiating two similar characters. The goal was to try to make food in DnD more interesting, while maintaining the simple book-keeping feature of rations.

Tell me any critiques you have! I've done some testing of the alternate features, but haven't gotten much info balance-wise on the subclasses or items, and many have undergone new revisions. Here is the changelog:

 

**V1.2**

* Added a revised Arcane Proficiency. Instead of being only abjuration or illusion like everything else, I made this opened to all spells. It is just the cantrips, all the others stay abjuration or illusion. I found this to be a handy DPS boost for the subclass, which focuses a lot on the defense and offense of your casters, and not that much on the damage of the character themself.
* Added Variant Class Feature: Supporter, for the opposite end of the damage spectrum from the Combatant. Overall, I always found that the class never really picked between damage and support, and these two features allow you to.
* Gave fire resistance to the Overlord. Really just felt needed with the abilities, and it gives a little extra early game power to it, to make up for the rather lackluster starting ability.
* Removed the Archery Fighting Style. Overall, it didn’t fit nicely with the Paragon as somebody pointed out to me, and the class is largely built on a melee focus that made it hard to make it a solid option.
* Added Hero’s Blessing, an additional healing option for the Protector. Despite being based on healing, I found it kinda fizzled out early on, reduced to spamming cure wounds for healing. This should help make it feel more rewarding at later levels.
* Reworked Group Force. It had been made to be based around helping a martial party do higher damage as a bit of a more DPS-focused Rallying Mark, but I found it had gone way off from that original idea.
* Removed Warlord’s Expertise. This is likely to be totally scrapped, I’m gonna place a different feature at a later date.
* Reworked Protected Entry to be a little more meaningful. It is less uses and has a max to allies, and though it is still rather powerful, can no longer just be spammed for huge scale healing
* Fixed tons of wording issues with the later parts and a couple early on
* Added a couple of quirks to the Overlord
* Added tables for leveling
* Added extra art and revised others
* Fixed a lot of formatting issues and language issues",UnearthedArcana,"My Warlord Expansion v1.2: An Addon to KibblesTasty's Warlord (w/ Alternate Features, Subclasses, and More!)",Compendium

These are two cantrip ideas I've had bouncing around for a while:

*Wild Card* is gambling themed, I wanted to convey both randomness and high rolling with it, without relying on extraneous damage type tables or the like.

*Misfortune* is a little more precarious on the balance side of things. Weaker effect and stronger save than *Mind Sliver* warranted upping the damage in my eyes, but for Clerics it edges out Sacred Flame in both Save Strength and effect (though the effect is still niche), and is only slightly worse in damage type. I'd say it's about on par with *Toll the Dead,* however, due to hitting more often but dealing less damage.",UnearthedArcana,Wild Card and Misfortune - Two Fortune Themed Cantrips For You To Try Your Luck With,Spell

The [original art](https://dsa.d20rpg.net/publ/spielbar/mensch/handwerker/4-1-0-33) is by DSA5Light (the featured art has some slight color modifications).

## Facsimile of Life

*3rd-level necromancy (ritual)*

* **Casting Time:** 1 action
* **Range:** 30 feet
* **Components:** V, S, M (a miniature onyx theater mask, worth at least 500 gp)
* **Duration:** 24 hours
* **Classes:** Warlock, Wizard

You bestow a mimicry of life onto an undead creature under your control within range that is humanoid in shape and has flesh. For example, a zombie, ghoul, ghast, wight, or mummy is a valid target but a skeleton or crawling claw is not.

Any exterior damage to the undead's body is repaired, though missing body parts are not regenerated. You may even have it grow hair. These effects are instantaneous and cannot be dispelled.

For the duration, color returns to the undead's skin, it moves more naturally, its stench of undeath is expunged, and it generally acts, sounds, and looks more like a living humanoid. A suspicious creature may see through the guise with a successful Wisdom (Insight or Perception) check against your spell save DC. The undead retains its creature type and is still detected and affected by magic that targets undead creatures.

The undead gains temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier when you first cast this spell and then each night at dusk for the duration. Physical damage to the undead's body repairs itself at the rate an average humanoid could heal similar wounds.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 5th- or 6th-level spell slot, the duration is 10 days; a 7th- or 8th-level spell slot, 30 days; a 9th-level spell slot, until dispelled. In addition, when cast using an 8th-level spell slot or higher, you may grant the target undead a limited ability to speak and understand (but not read) one language of your choice (that you know) for the duration. The undead speaks with limited vocabulary and poor grammar and may fail to understand speech if it is too complicated (though it still understands your commands as well it did before this spell was cast).",UnearthedArcana,Facsimile of Life – 3rd-Level Necromancy – Make Your Undead More Presentable,Spell

I agree with the Blunt Force Trauma part, seems quite unfit for the flavor. I do like the concept of free reloading / aiming siege weapon, but i need to come up with ways for it not to be abusable, reloading cannon every turn is quite OP. So i think i'd put the free reload/aim in the Unbridled Titan Form.

# Martial Archetypes

**Guerrilla.** A spin on the Battle Master Archetype from the PHB, the Guerrilla is focused on flexibility when preparing for combat. You gain a few maneuvers (and non-scaling superiority dice), but you can change one out over a long rest. You eventually gain some thematic proficiencies and movement options, and the ability to switch your Fighting Style. Not sure if the versatility is powerful enough to warrant a subclass, but I personally like the idea.

**Pact Warrior.** Part of my ongoing [Blood Hunter, Dissected](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MJZYIYDTnRm7GURb32e) project, the Pact Warrior is my attempt to balance the Profane Soul with 5e norms. It’s basically a tweaked version of the Eldritch Knight with Warlock spellcasting.

**Phalanx Warrior.** My take on a defensive Fighter based on the ancient Phalanx formation. Provide a marital take on the Paladin’s defensive auras.

**Quartermaster.** One of my first ever homebrew subclasses, the Quartermaster is a support fighter who prepares rations for their teammates. Play as a cook or team mom!

**Marksman.** The first draft of a dedicated ranged specialist. I’ve taken things from the UA: Sharpshooter, MM Gunslinger, and the Runeterra Renegade. Of course, I’ve put my own spin on it, trying to keep it simple. Definitely interested in feedback on this one.

**Tinker Knight.** This subclass is really O U T - T H E R E. I originally wanted to design a Fighter that incorporated Artificer Infusions, but it morphed into something else. It ended up being designed based on the Rune Knight in *TCoE*. I hesitate to even put this odd subclass out there!

305,go0beh5,lnh2v8,"Hi! The Cook Class is a Constitution-based support inspired by the Zelda BotW video game and especially the Dungeon Meshi (Delicious'n'Dungeon) Manga. The core class functionality revolves around providing temporary hitpoints to their travelling companions and preparing Adventuring Recipes (short term or utility abilities) on every rest. The Cook can then focus on either maneuvering around and providing help to their melee companions or staying in the back line to dish out aid. Either position allows the cook to use utility-based 'Meal Prep' Recipes to support, heal, or take some hits in order to aid their allies. Further along at 5th level, the Cook gains access to powerful Monstrous Ingredients whose contents come from various monster types and provide powerful bonuses to the cook's repertoire.

On top of the base class, there are currently two powerful subclasses (known as cookbooks); the Cookbook of the Well-Seasoned and the Cookbook of the Unsavory. Well-Seasoned has a focus on bringing out their party's comradery through their cooking and learning from their companions along the way. Unsavory is a bit darker, in that they use their cooking to more destructive ends, being skilled with disguising poisons in their food and delivering damage from a short distance.

One of the meta themes to the class is to emphasise ""different ingredients"". That is, if two people play as a cook, even as the same subclass, your playstyles may end up being quite different from each other, based on your selection of ""ingredients"" (culinary expertise, meal prep recipes, monstrous ingredients, and cookbook).

Version 1.2 has some corrections to the document. It also includes a collection of art to highlight some of the flavour of playing a cook.

An updated version of a bard college for those wanting to rock on. The stereotypical bard is usually seen as someone suave and full of grace, usually great at all kinds of social interactions. These bards however go against the grain, instead of wanting to put their charm to use, they want to make the most noise they can and make everyone around them as amped up as they are.

308,go0xbvq,lnl31x,"Presenting the Dwarven Warsmith ([GMBinder link here](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MTunFrIRldStzNpJI0D)), a new martial subclass for the 5e artificer! This came about from my wanting to build a Forge Cleric/Battle Smith multiclass and finding it didn’t quite fit what I was envisioning. I wanted to focus on magic weapons and armor, rather than having a robot pet. At the same time, I didn’t feel Armorer fit because of its focus on integrating your infusions into your Power Armor. Overall, I wanted a more ancient feel, like these were the artificers of old. They weren’t building fancy intricate mechanisms, they were beating magic into metal and carving arcane runes. So I feel like this fills a couple niches that the current artificer subclasses don’t provide.

I wanted it to feel different from the Battle Smith other than just losing the pet, so the spells are overall more elemental and damage-focused, with inspiration from the Forge Cleric spell list. Also note that it’s less SAD than the Battle Smith, naturally favoring becoming a Strength/Int half-caster, like an intelligence-casting paladin, which I think is a neat idea.

The benefits are simple and workmanlike: smith’s tools, fire resistance and a Fighting Style; Extra Attack; some extra infusions a la the Armorer; and some extra spells a la the Alchemist, with a little bit of choice thrown in for fun. I also really like the dwarf-themed magic items in 5e and wanted to make sure you had access to them. That’s really what brings the dwarf flavor in, though I wanted to be clear that you don’t have to be a dwarf to take this subclass, you just have to be following in their tradition. And all of this could easily be reflavored for a campaign with no dwarves, or an incompatible idea of them; just rename the items to sound more generic, call it the Warsmith, and you’re good.

310,go1gdek,lno7yj,"Hi everyone! This is my first subclass that I have submitted here, and is the first version of it, so I would really appreciate any constructive criticism and suggestions for improvements!

I've always wanted a shadow-themed warlock and didn't quite feel satisfied with the Raven Queen UA subclass. Then I came across Mask in the pantheon and thought he would be a cool deity to build a subclass around.

Taking from Mask's lore, I designed the class to favour the out-of-combat, roleplay-side of things (whilst still maintaining the standard level of damage from a Warlock and their spells) to help create interesting situations for players such as amazingly succeeding in driving an enemy crazy by making them hear voices and see things or failing spectacularly and suddenly appearing in a room surrounded by enemies. I also feel this creates another option for filling the role of scout in the party.

I for one feel that weapon combat can be a bit... lacking, in D&D. Now, is the lack of shield options *really* a problem? No. Do I want more options? **Yes.**

So I made this, as part of an expanded equipment/martial revamp project. I've actually been sitting on the shields themselves for a while now, but I finally got around to making the feats and updating the proficiencies and such, as well as a few minor changes.

What do y'all think? Feedback is appreciated (although I'm bad at replying, sorry). Hope y'all enjoy it.

Final note: *fuck I forgot to add starting equipment shit......* View the homebrewery link for that I guess.

Edit: On further thought, the invocation is too powerful, seeing as how it lets you make stupidly expensive (and thusly powerful) shields at level 3... I'm changing that.

315,gnw6ub7,lmp5y7," The College of Flames Bard is a short range, combat oriented bard that dances through the battlefield, burning any who get too close. 

**Burning Secrets** offers a couple damaging spells to the bard at an early level. Both are short range, to fit the motif of a fire dancer. I do not want this subclass to be a fire blaster who slings firebolts and scorching rays. 

Despite operating in close range, this bard does not get raw defensive features like armor or shield proficiencies. **Fire Dancing** fills this role, allowing the bard to weave into the fray, use their fire spell, and dance away while enemies are distracted. It also can punish enemies that give chase.

**Dancing Blade** turns the otherwise lackluster *Flame Blade* into a legitimate threat and ensures that you will almost always have a way to activate your fire dancing. Powerwise, it closely mirrors a melee-range Spiritual weapon, with a few very minor tradeoffs.

The capstone, **Resplendent Flames**, grants you a burst of damage and further defensive and offensive capabilities at the cost of your concentration.

I left it out fire resistance intentionally. I think that the performance value of a fire dancer partly relies on the perceived risk factor, with the audience knowing that one wrong step is enough to get you burned.

If you can take casting abilities from a lvl 20 wizard   that is as powerful as you can become

After lvl 9 every single spell changes the world.

330,g5tdwa5,ivt1zp,"So, as a bit of background – recently I’ve been playing a campaign and the DM let me play with u/hakuna_dentata’s Commoner class just for the hell of it. I had a lot fun, it was great for roleplay, and it kind of inspired me to make my own.

[This version](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/bz4ugb/updated_version_of_my_commoner_class_because/) was the inspiration, but mine is pretty much a wholly different class.

My version of the commoner is meant to be more like an actual player class – I’ve removed the restriction that all abilities scores have to be 10 (though that’s still a variant rule for those who want the challenge), and the commoner now has subclasses and also supports multiclassing. Some parts of the original (like the Questgiver) were actually really overpowered in practice, so it’s been tweaked all over.

An explanation of my reasoning behind the class:

The core mechanic of the class is all based around the Help action. From 3rd level onwards, you get the Help action as a bonus action (same as Mastermind rogues) so you can hit the target yourself and then help an ally out all in a single round.

At fifth level, you get a feature that gives you a pseudo-second attack: you can hit the target, help an ally, and then you get to take a second attack if your ally's attack lands. At level 10, there is a ‘teams’ feature; you designate a certain group and then you can use Help on multiple people at once. You make a pretty good sidekick to a team of better damage-dealers.

Overall, the commoner class is still noticeably weaker than other classes, but it’s very flexible and you get to bring some unique abilities to the table.

The subclasses are more on that theme: the Farmer turns you into a Fighter/Barbarian sidekick, the Clerk turns you into a Wizard sidekick, the Vagabond makes you a Rogue sidekick, and the Merchant has some niche features good for supporting the whole party.

Edit: Based on feedback, there probably will be a v2 of this class at some point. A couple of commenters have quite rightfully pointed out a few features which are broken / redundant. I'll keep the GM binder link up to date with what I can, but the larger modifications will have to wait for the next revision.

The Savant is a non-magic, intelligence-based class that I created to fill what I perceived to be an unfulfilled niche in the officially published classes of D&D 5e. After a lot of great feedback, both from this subreddit and some great playtesters, I think the Savant is in a great place. *I’ve even created its own little “class icon” (as seen on the cover)!*

# The Savant v2.7.0

The Savant is a class for those who want to use their sharp wit and potent observational skills to confound their enemies and aid their allies. They rely heavily on Intelligence, and excel in exploration, information gathering, and offer their allies support in combat.

**Class Features.** Pretty standard, think Rogue when comparing them to another class. 1d8 hit die, some light armor, a few weapon proficiencies, some tools (which I love), and three skills.

**Adroit Analysis.** The keystone ability of the Savant. Designate a target and you can use your INT for attacks. Based on your Academic Discipline (subclass) you also learn some info about them.

**Astute Defense.** Think RDJ’s Sherlock Holmes. Defend yourself by predicting attacks. A variation of Unarmored Defense.

**Perfect Recall.** A ribbon ability that makes you feel like you’re playing the smartest person in the room.

**Expert Student.** Allows you some flexible proficiencies. You gain more as you level.

**Unyielding Mind.** Gain INT mod bonus to INT/WIS/CHA saves and ability checks as a reaction. The genius should be resistant to mind control, etc.

**Academic Discipline (subclass).** Choose from six options depending on the type of genius you want to play: Archaeologist, Inquisitive, Naturalist, Philosopher, Physician, or Tactician!

**ASI’s.** Same as most classes.

**Potent Observation.** Not extra attack, but it keeps the Savant relevant in combat. Similar to a Rogue’s Sneak Attack or a Cleric’s Divine Strike.

**Expert Educator.** Share your proficiencies with your party. 

**Ever Vigilant.** You can’t be surprised and add INT to initiative. Your quick reflexes help with that.

**Reliable Talent.** The greatest historian of their age shouldn’t be able to botch a History check.

**Mental Refresh.** A pseudo-legendary resistance for mental abilities.

**Profound Insight.** A massive improvement to your Adroit Analysis.

**Undisputed Genius.** Gain godlike levels of Intelligence!

# Academic Disciplines

**Archaeologist.** Raid Arks, Temples of Doom, and Crusade for stolen treasure with this historian-in-action. Expertise in History and Investigation, learn of creature’s languages, identify relics, avoid traps, confound your foes, and wield magical objects of all kinds!

**Inquisitive.** Solve the case with this Savant with an eye for detail. Expertise in Insight and Investigation, learn if creatures are deceiving you, expanded crit range against humanoid targets of your Adroit Analysis, and see through illusions and falsehoods of all kinds.

**Naturalist.** Guide your party through the treacherous wilds with this outdoor academic! Expertise in Animal Handling and Nature, expanded crit range against beast/monstrosity/plant targets of your adroit analysis, prepare your allies to survive in nature, and calm beasts, plants, and monstrosities. 

**Philosopher.** Master the spoken word and the deeper language of the universe with this powerful thinker! Expertise in Arcana and Religion, learn of creatures’ alignments or planes of origin, speak powerful reality-altering Theorems, and resist the denizens of the outer planes.

**Physician.** Heal the sick and cripple your foes with this non-magical healer! Expertise with Medicine and the Herbalism Kit, learn creature’s current hit points, support your allies with a slew of Medical Actions, and deftly move about the battlefield.

**Tactician.** Command your allies and organize the field of battle with this cunning commander! Expertise in History, proficiency with medium armor, shields, and non-heavy weapons, command your allies to attack, defend, and move, and resist charms and fear.

# Thank You!

A big thank you to everyone who has offered critique, feedback, and playtested the Savant! Of course, I am open to feedback you have for the class, but I think it is in a pretty solid spot where it is now. The subclasses may get some (very) minor tweaks, but the base Savant is pretty well solidified.

333,g7r8xs2,j528yu,"TL;DR: I made an uncannily similar class a while back, and you addressed some of the issues I encountered with that class well with the Savant. I do think that some of the features could use power tweaks, but overall good job. 

 I've been working on a remarkably similar class (like weirdly similar) for a while, but I haven't touched it in months because I came across some design concerns that I didn't know how to address. I think many of those issues are relevant to your class as well, and I'd like to hear your thoughts on them. My two main concerns were how much Intelligence actually mattered mechanically and how smooth the class felt to play (i.e. how dependent it was on resources and whether players would feel like they were choked for them).  I think you did a pretty good job addressing these things with the Savant. Adroit Analysis and Astute Defense are ""passive"" abilities that put the importance of Intelligence for this class on-par with the primary stat of the martial classes, and the two abilities that use resources, Unyielding Mind and certain subclass features, draw upon different resource pools. 

The way I see it, this archetype occupies a design space somewhere near bards and rogues; bards and rogues have quite a bit of horizontal depth (i.e. as skill monkeys/non-combat utility) coupled with vertical depth (e.g. expertise, spells for bards, sneak attack for rogues). 

This class has similar levels of horizontal depth (if not more), but it seems a little lacking in vertical depth. The base class abilities seem good as they give a wide array of horizontal depth, but some of the capstone abilities seem lackluster, e.g. Undisputed Genius, Master Philosopher, and Master Physician. Undisputed Genius is a fine ability, but I don't feel like a genius when I get a pure, numerical stat increase. My criticisms with the Savant are super nitpicky though—overall, great stuff. 

Archaeologist - I like this subclass. I think you capture the feel of 'dungeon delver' pretty well. Student of History: good. Daring Determination: good. Astute Offense: doesn't make a lot of sense to me from a flavor perspective, but a good ability. It doesn't seem to build upon any of the other subclass features. Use Magic Device: makes sense from a flavor perspective, but seems underwhelming mechanically (I don't have much experience with magic items that have use restrictions so this criticism is kinda unfounded). Master Archaeologist: good.  

Inquisitive - I like this subclass. I like that you juxtaposed this subclass with deceivers; it cemented the flavor for me. Student of Truth: the expertise is good, but the Adroit Analysis improvement seems super marginal compared to other subclasses. Inquisitive Insight: first part, good; the second part doesn't make sense to me flavor wise but it's a good ability. Eye for Detail: good. Seeker of Truth: seems good. Master Inquisitive: good.  

Naturalist - I like it for the most part but it seems situational. Student of Nature: good. Conservationist: seems like a worse version of Inquisitive Insight, but it's probably campaign dependent. Outdoorsman: I like it, and it seems good for the most part, but extreme environmental training seems way stronger than the other options. Wild Insights: situational, but flavorful and strong when it can be used. Master Naturalist: seems ok but nothing great. I do like that it is the culmination of study reflected in Outdoorsman, though. 

Philosopher - A very cool subclass that seems pretty strong. Student of Thought: good. Resound Theorems: great. I love the power level as the feature is relevant regardless of level, though Confounding Theorem has some overlap with Potent Observation. Unwavering belief: good. Supreme Understanding: good. Master Philosopher: the first part seems fine, but I really don't like abilities that marginally increase the number of times you can use a class feature (I'm looking at you Superior Inspiration, Relentless, Perfect Self, and Sorcerous Restoration).

Physician - Student of Medicine: good, but I'd include the bit about medicine checks using Intelligence instead of Wisdom in this section. Combat Medic: seems good. Medical Neutrality: good. Field Surgeon: good. Master Physician: this feature seems grossly underpowered. An additional 5 thp at level 17 is not very valuable. The additional healing from hit dice is nice, but an additional 5.5 hp (on average) for a d12 hit die (the maximum) doesn't seem like a relevant boost to Healing Surge. 

Tactician - I think you did a good job with this subclass (much better than my attempt). The Order Action options are individually compact but cover a wide array of combat scenarios. Student of War: good; the Adroit Analysis buff seems like the strongest by far compared to the other subclasses. Tactical Commander: good. Unwavering Resolve: good. Strategic Genius: extraordinarily powerful; at 13th level you effectively get three attacks per turn with Unwavering Resolve and four attacks per turn at level 17. This is three levels before fighter gets four attacks per turn, *and* you also get the incredible versatility the base Savant offers. This is offset somewhat by the need to expend uses of the Order Action, but you're going to have 10 uses per short rest. And if I'm reading these abilities correctly, you can use Action Surge to issue two commands on your turn, making up to 7 attacks in a turn. Master Tactician: good; it seems like a better version of Master Physician.

1. For the Archaeologist, you'd have to obey the normal rules for using magic items until you reach 13th level. That means you cannot technically use any magic items that produce spells unless you have the spellcasting trait (which the Savant doesn't). The official rules are [here](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Magic%20Items#content), but as always, check with your DM. Though once you hit 13th level, go wild!

2. I'm not 100% sure I understand your question for this one, but you'd use your Bonus Action to mark a creature with *Adroit Analysis*, then your Action to attack that creature.

**Cake Cutter**

*Weapon (Dagger), Legendary (Requires Enlightenment)*

This knife reveals the horrible truths of the world.

When you successfully damage an enemy with this weapon, the enemy must make a Constitution saving throw.

On a failed save, that creature takes an additional 1D10 frost damage and the cut area shows that inside, they were just an ordinary cake. This permanent reminder remains until they heal or have heat applied to them at 400°F for 20 minutes. Any creature that makes a bite attack against that creature during this time deals an additional 1D10 damage and heals themselves for the same amount of damage dealt.

On a successful save, they still reveal themselves to be cake, because they were always cake. Who knows what your friends are hididng?

Since its conception in 2016 it’s caught fire in the hands of dozens of dozens of playtesters, been featured in a podcast, and filed into many a DM’s allowable homebrew. There have even been a few fan-made spinoffs! Myself (u/Zarieth) and my coauthor (u/WriteOftenPlayNever) would like to bring you now a wholly revamped Witch.

Much is the same, don’t worry about changing your character sheets *too* much. Your bookmarks to the old Witch will now point to an out-of-print page with the link to the new version. Mostly balance and wording… oh yeah, I think you’re all owed some ***new subclasses?*** That’s right, we’re introducing the freshly minted covenants of ***Silver and Steel.***

Covenant of Silver: Mirror, mirror in my hand, who is the strangest in the land? Not just any glittering bauble— a silvered looking glass that captures that most memorable fairytales and folklore collision of mirrors, souls, and witchcraft. Focusing on the powers of sight, transformation, and the entrapment, this subclass follows a progression with unique abilities you won’t find the like of in any other covenants.

Covenant of Steel: Could this be… a ***martial*** subclass?? Finally? It sure is! No cursed pact-swords here, your witchblade is a physical manifestation of a soul you have bound. Strike down enemies emotionally and physically at the same time with the eldritch steel of your choice, augmented with your pistachio and gish flavoured spirit magic.

We hope you all enjoy! And bookmark the class at GMBinder here  [https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-L7gG0ZSzBHgbWv7t\_wf](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-L7gG0ZSzBHgbWv7t_wf) for updates!

Guilt slipped through the cracks a little, it's significantly changed on the [GMBinder version](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-L7gG0ZSzBHgbWv7t_wf)

Trust was a bit of an experimental spirit, but hopefully should work on the ""it does what it says it does"" principle in terms of clarity. They now know those spells, and if they're a prepared caster they now have those spells prepared, anything that they could do with a spell known/prepared they could do with a trust spell (like upcast it, using your own ability score), it's effectively an artificial version of a subclass spell list

I just went in and tweaked the wording on binding rites veeery slightly so it should be clear that you can bind any spirit of your choice, and that being restricted by location or type or proximity to dead things is not mechanically supported even if it is supported by fluff, in the same way sneak attack does not actually require you to be sneaking :P",UnearthedArcana,"[Class] The Witch 3.0 | We’re back, Witches! | From the original creators of the popular spirit-binding class",Class
361,fz5kj8v,hx1ssd,"Firstly, thank you for the detailed response :)

Channel Spell is a bit of a ribbon, but the main method you'd be doing that with is with Quickening to see into the ethereal plane, and then a spell that targets by sight. Also any planar portals you could see and pass through would give this effect. A niche situation for sure, but it should make a witch think about how they can affect changes across planes, including spells that already do cross planar shenanigans 

Blood's first ability is instant and action-less, which I may look into clarifying, since it isn't as clear as we'd like that it happens immediately whenever you release a spirit

Dark spirit is a permanent, limited subtle spell yes, since you can only replace somatic or verbal components with it one at a time, but I may remove the line about being bound since it implies this only kicks in when you need it to

Whoops on find familiar, that's a change that didn't make it from the notes into the document, you're supposed to get it for free in that feature, just to cover the bases in case you haven't already picked it up  
good catch though, thank you :)

I think Blood and Ruin's 2nd level ability don't immediately lend themselves to a playstyle shift, that's true, but they do scale and scale well. Blood makes you want to stand next to your allies to patch them up whenever you release spirits, and the more powerful spirits you have and the more of them you bind, the more constant use you'll find for the ability, and the more it will become a different playstyle from the militant aggressive style that Doom encourages, where you curse enemies at crucial points to ensure they miss or fail, which will again grow in power and frequency as you have more spirits

I'm glad you like it!

I'm a big fan of mimics, and for a long time I've tried to come up with a way that you could gain one as a companion. As much as I'd love to create a mimic companion that a player could control in combat, it would be a nightmare to balance - far too strong at low levels, but far too flimsy at high levels. Eventually, I came up with Toothy! Toothy is a very versatile companion who can become any kind of adventuring equipment you require. Just make sure you never skip Toothy's meal times :P

365,ghfq7p6,kmocac,"**Design Notes:**

Basically, Clerics lack any cantrip attack roll option, so I thought to give them one that was cool, thematic, and that might actually compete with Toll the Dead; at least with the right group/build, particularly one that can hand out buffs to/advantage on attack rolls.

And yes, I was inspired by Dark Souls/Lightning Spear.

&#x200B;

**Balance/Math:**

Toll leads Brightlance by 1.5 damage per damage dice; it effectively deals 30% more damage before adjusting for accuracy, so that's 6 points of accuracy Brightlance would have to make up for by being an attack, minus whatever effective value you would assign to the extra range with disadvantage, and maybe slightly better damage typing.

Lightning is worse than necrotic as a typing, while radiant is better; I believe each type of damage, adjusting for all monsters with resistance, weakness and vulnerability works out to the following effective damage multipliers: 100 - % of creatures with immunity - (% of creatures with resistance minus % of creatures with vulnerability) \* 0.5 / 100 = effective damage multiplier

* **Radiant:** (100-0.3-(0.41)\*0.5)/100= 0.99495 effective damage multiplier
* **Lightning:** (100-3.61-(6.85)\*0.5)/100 = 0.92965
* **Radiant/Lightning averaged:** = 0.9623
* **Necrotic:** (100-3.2-(4.74)\*0.5)/100 = 0.9443
* **Difference:** 0.018 or 1.8%

Assuming a 10% accuracy differential holds true in favour of Brightlance per ([https://forums.giantitp.com/showthread.php?562144-D-amp-D-5e-MM-Monster-Defences-(AC-vs-Saving-Throws)](https://forums.giantitp.com/showthread.php?562144-D-amp-D-5e-MM-Monster-Defences-(AC-vs-Saving-Throws))), and I adjust damage to account for typing, assuming a 60/70% hit rate, this is what I get, in terms of comparative crit, accuracy and damage type adjusted damage:

Toll the Dead Damage Dice \* Accuracy \* Damage Type Modifier / ((Brightlance Damage Dice \* Non-Crit Hit Chance + Brightlance Damage Dice \* Crit Damage Modifier \* Crit Chance) \* Damage Type Modifier)

(6.5 \* 0.6 \* 0.9443)/((5 \* 0.65 + 5 \* 2 \* 0.05) \* 0.9623) = 1.02

In otherwords, Toll has a 2% accuracy, crit, and damage type adjusted damage edge over Lance; minus a bit for the additional range, and it's about balanced with Toll. I'd say Toll is probably still better on the whole and out of the box, but Lance of course has the edge of synergy potential, so this is fine.

**Edit:** Well I was bound to screw something up. You regain half of your TOTAL hit dice upon finishing a long rest, not half your expended hit dice.

**Edit 2:** I've been reminded that Great Weapon Master is a thing, which throws off my numbers for Rip and Tear. Some tweaks were made and the feature now reads:

>When a melee attack you make against an object or creature reduces it to a number  of hit points lower than your strength score, you can use your reaction  to immediately reduce the target to 0 hit points.

**Edit 3:** Some clarification for the Incorruptible feature was in order, the feature now reads:

> While raging you are immune to mind control and similar effects that  would force you to act against your will, such as the Suggestion spell  or a Ghost's Possession ability. Additionally, you ignore the effect of  the charmed condition that prevents you from targeting the charmer, as  well as any similar effects that would prevent you from attacking a  specific creature, such as the Sanctuary spell or Instinctive Charm  feature. 

I wanted to make a subclass that fitted the raw, unyeilding nature of the Doom Slayer (he IS a barbarian, I don't care what anyone says) while still being broad enough to fit other types of characters if a player wants to take it that way. Kratos from God of War for example, would fit quite well here.

I ignored the weapons, equipment and other fancy stuff Doomguy has because in my opinion none of it has much to do with the man himself. He's been shown more than capable of getting the job done with his bare hands if necessary. Plus the fact that the BFG-9000 maybe won't fit in most d&d campaigns. I focused on what I think makes him badass, which is his raw strength/power, unstoppable nature (base barbarian has these covered) and his completely unconquerable will. The later is the flavour focus I went with.

For features we have Feed the Fury and Unrelenting, which come from the Slayer's ability to heal by killing his foes. I originally had it healing directly off of kills but it was difficult to balance it in a way that wasn't either way too powerful or really weak, so I went with the hit dice instead. I didn't analyse this feature too scrupulously so the exact amount healed or the number of hit dice regained on a kill may need adjustments.

Incorruptible is just that, the Doom Slayer is Incorruptible. I wanted to make this feature different enough from the Frenzy barbarian while still keeping the ability to resist charm effects. The trade-off is no immunity to frightened and being vulnerable to certain charm based features, such as cutting words, while allowing Slayer barbarians to shrug off mind control effects through their furious dedication to their purpose (in Doom's case, killing demons).

Blood Strike is a tweaked version of the blood punch from Doom Eternal. I wanted to keep the ability to recharge the punch by killing while keeping it balanced, so I leaned into the hit dice being used for both offensive and defensive abilities. Keeps things dynamic in my opinion.

Rip and Tear is of course, based on glory kills. At a glance it may seem too powerful but consider: A 14th level barbarian with 20 strength and a nonmagical greataxe can deal up to 20 damage on a basic hit (12 from greataxe + 5 from strength + 3 from rage). That's not accounting for magic weapons or other boons the barbarian might have so far into a campaign. The reduction to 0 hit points instead of an outright kill is so that creatures like trolls or an enemy the DM doesn't want killed in that moment still have options.",UnearthedArcana,Barbarian: Path of the Slayer - Rip and tear until it is done!,Subclass

377,gc8w56j,ju0zjc,"New version of the commoner class! Now with balance updates, improved wording, and three new subclasses!

About a month ago, I created this homebrew class here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/ivt1zp/the\_commoner\_a\_fullyplayable\_support\_class\_with\_4/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/ivt1zp/the_commoner_a_fullyplayable_support_class_with_4/)

Some people seemed to like it, but there were a few errors that people pointed out and there a few different aspects that needed straightening. So I went away, did a bit of playtesting, and updated some features.

The theme of the commoner is still the same; it’s a sidekick class at heart. It’s still weaker than other classes, but it's very flexible and very good at propping up the party. At low levels the commoner doesn’t do that much, but at higher levels it becomes much more significant. A single commoner by themselves is fairly useless, but a commoner helping allies will boost the overall party’s effectiveness by quite a bit.

There’s been changes throughout, but here is the summary of the key ones.

* I’ve removed the more problematic class features – particularly the ones that allowed you to copy traits from other members of your party. Those were a nice flavour, but in practice they were too easy to exploit.
* I’ve updated/reworded ‘Use What You Got’ into ‘Trusty Weapon’, reflecting more what I originally intended. Every commoner now gets their own unique weapon, which would be an improvised weapon to anyone else. RP-wise, imagine a self-taught commoner that has learned how to use a frying pan, a shovel or a slingshot rather than a proper sword or bow. Your trusty weapon is special because in your hands it does not rely on Strength or Dexterity for attack or damage. Overall, Trusty Weapon is still weaker than a regular martial weapon across the entire level range, but it’s reliable and there are a few niche cases where it becomes useful. At level 6 it also gains some decent control effects.
* I’ve fixed the ‘Can’t Believe That Worked’ feature to require a Con save, which was perhaps the single most broken aspect of the previous version.
* I’ve updated the ‘Teamwork Gets It Done’ mechanic to make progression more linear; your team size is limited to 2 people at level 10, and increases to 3 people at level 15. Bonus attacks increase proportionally.
* The subclasses are mostly unchanged, but a few of the 1st level features have been nerfed. Clerks now get a single cantrip at level 1.

Now for the three news subclasses:

* Thugs are the most combat-heavy commoner subclass – they are the barbarian sidekick. They can be damaging, but also punching bags. Stomp ‘Em Good helps make grappling more useful, while Brutish Fury deals bonus damage to the enemy while also dealing hurting yourself. A thug could deal a very respectable amount of damage that way (especially if combined with the GWM feat), but they’d also kill themselves so quickly. The level 9 feature is more of the same; Headbutt allows you to straight up knock your enemy unconscious, but if you fail a Con roll then you’re the one going to sleep.
* Innkeepers make for the ultimate team mom – the cleric sidekick. They’ve got so many support abilities to prop party members up during and between rests, and would be great for roleplay opportunities. They do pull their weight though; it would be well-worth having an innkeeper around just to feed people between rests.
* Jesters are, of course, the bard sidekick. They are also the polar opposite to the vagabond. If you have a longing desire to act as bait for dangerous creatures, then play a jester.

I don’t think I’ll be adding any more subclasses – seven is already too many, and I think I’ve filled the major roles. The only other subclass I was maybe considering was the Woodsman, but I couldn’t really see a point in it (that’s right, rangers don’t even deserve a sidekick).

High Scaling: https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/jnUMnNlwP

Final Edit:

After reviewing the advantages and disadvantages, and considering the different arguments, I've gone with a single scaling d8. I wanted to up the damage to d8 to keep it just ahead of the d12 version of toll the dead, as I consider the two conditions about equal.

Low Scaling (d8): https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/oOsA8SE90

As for my reasoning I came to this: 
> I have looked and considered how it stacks up to the other cantrips, and I have chosen to make it weaker for the reasons stated in my other

>The ideal that similar cantrips must have the same powerlevel is a falacy. It all depends on the context of the situation. Since GFB and BB exists in the same context, available to the same classes, you nearly always are put to choose between these two cantrips on equal grounds. As such, to make an interesting choice, and to provide varied options, we make both equally powerful. Otherwise the weaker cantrip wouldn't have a function.

>However, Radiant mark doesn't exist within the same context, it is available to clerics, which can't pick GFB or BB. As such Cleric never has a direct choice between those three cantrips, and we don't have to balance them in the same way to make options equal and varied.

>Radiant mark competes with Toll the dead, so I've balanced it against that cantrip for the builds that it is relevant to.

>Making Radiant Mark weaker actually makes for more options as the cleric now can choose to use Toll the dead, Radiant mark, or spend resources to acquire GFB or BB.

>If Radiant Mark was more powerful than toll the dead, then toll the dead isn't an option. And it would be a waste of resources to acquire GFB and BB since they aren't more powerful to make up for the cost.

>Putting the Radiant Mark where I did actually makes for more interesting character building and it also doesn't increase the powerlevel of the already powerful spirit guardian melee range cleric setup.


**Why it is needed**

The cleric class in 5e has a lot of subclasses. Several of these seem to be geared towards a melee build, and the War and Tempest clerics gain proficiency with martial weapons.

Yet when you do the math, even the war cleric would be better off casting toll the dead than actually using their melee weapon at some levels.


So we need a cantrip that does enough damage to make the melee cleric viable. And why not do it in a typical cleric way and make it a team effort cantrip?

**How is it balanced?**

The cantrip is balanced around being an alternative to Toll the dead, and being a bit weaker than green flame blade and booming blade. (But easier to trigger).

So to be exact, we want a cantrip subclass cleric to have around the same damage as a martial one. 

Since melee clerics already have the option of acquiring booming blade and green flame blade, giving clerics access to radiant mark doesn't suddenly make melee cleric insane, as they already could do it at a cost.

**The Math**

Our goal is to make radiant mark powerful enough that a melee cleric would want to cast it over toll the dead. We also want to keep it competetive with the clerics that get a bonus to their cantrips.

 First we note that toll the dead has several advantages:

* Toll the dead works in both melee and at range. Radiant Mark requires melee.
* Radiant mark causes some of your damage to be dealt at a later turn along with more damage. This means that some enemies might get an extra turn or you might get more overkill damage.
* Radiant Mark requires you to scale str/dex along with wisdom for optimal damage. Toll the Dead just uses wisdom.

Edit: TabaxiTaxidermist pointed out some advantages to attack roll based attacks for the cleric.

>(1) Attack rolls have a chance to crit. This results in a DPR increase of .25 - 1. That DPR increase increases if the cleric can get [...] advantage on their attacks.

>(2) Attack rolls benefit from Advantage. They also suffer from Disadvantage, but in my experience there have been more effects/spells that grant advantage than monsters that impose disadvantage.

>(3) Along the same lines there are more effects and magic items that increase your chance to hit (like the Bless spell) than there are effects that increase your spell save DC.

There are more minor advantages/disadvantages, but these are the major ones that I will take into account.

The damage of Toll the Dead at each tier is (For the cantrip subclasses):

* level 1-4: 1d8/1d12, 
* level 5-7: 2d8/2d12,
* level 8-11: 2d8/2d12 + wis
* level 11-16: 3d8/3d12 + wis
* level 17-20: 4d8/4d12 + wis

If we say that we on average get a 1d10 out of toll the dead, then convert the 1d10 to the average roll of the die = 5.5 we get:

* level 1-4: 5.5 necrotic damage
* level 5-7: 11 necrotic damage
* level 8-11: 11 + wis necrotic damage
* level 11-16: 16.5 + wis necrotic damage
* level 17-20: 22 + wis necrotic damage

I would note that I get 1d12 out of toll the dead most of the time, so that might even be a bit low.

Now for the melee attack. I will assume you are using a simple weapon with 1d6 damage, since not all have access to martial weapons, and those who do spend some of their subclass's ""power budget"" to get that ability. I also assume str, but you can switch that to dex with no impact on the numbers here.

Damage for melee attack (radiant mark damage in parentheses):
* level 1-4: 1d6 + str (+wis) 
* level 5-7: 1d6 + str (1d6+wis) 
* level 8-11: 1d6 + 1d8 + str (1d6+wis) 
* level 11-13: 1d6 + 1d8 + str (2d6+wis)
* level 14-16: 1d6 + 2d8 + str (2d6+wis)
* level 17-20: 1d6 + 2d8 + str (3d6+wis)

Converted to average damage. (assuming str modifier = 3) 

* level 1-4: 6.5 (+wis) = 6.5 + wis
* level 5-7: 6.5 (+3.5+wis) = 10 + wis
* level 8-11: 11 (+3.5+wis) = 14.5 + wis
* level 11-13: 11 (+7+wis) = 18 + wis
* level 14-16: 15.5 (+7+wis) = 22.5 + wis
* level 17-20: 15.5 (+10.5+wis) = 26 + wis

If you compare the two lists you get the melee build having slightly more dps with this cantrip. However it gets really close if the party is fighting a strong creature where the cleric can get d12 with nearly every toll the dead. And if they can't, then you're in a situation where radiant mark leads to more overkill. 

Along with the other advantages to toll the dead, I think this is a good balance.",UnearthedArcana,Radiant Mark. A cantrip to make melee clerics viable,Spell

High Scaling: https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/jnUMnNlwP

A few of you pointed out some formatting issues that has been fixed in these newer versions.

Other than that two main points were pointed out.

> Melee clerics are already viable.

This is perhaps due to poor wording from me. I meant that swinging your mace isn't viable compared to using toll the dead.

I fully agree that melee clerics are viable. Walking into the fray with 22 AC in heavy armor, a lot of hit points, swinging with a spiritual weapon and having spirit guardians around you while also using toll the dead is great. Tanky and great damage.

The fact that the melee build for clerics is already rather powerful is actually a part of why I nerfed the scaling on the second topic:

> The cantrip should scale just like green flame blade (GFB) and Booming blade (BB).

Just before I posted this cantrip, I actually heavily nerfed the scaling. I'm likely to keep the good scaling for my own games (as the massive amounts of homebrew causes what's viable to be a quite different field). 

I had the scaling to increase 1d6 on both the attack and the marked creature, such that it scaled just like GFB, but with a lower die. Since Radiant Mark (RM) is easier to trigger the second part of, and since it has a great damage type, I thought that a bit less damage was in order. This is also the ""high scaling"" edition I've linked. 


> So why did I nerf it?  

Should we use GFB and BB as a golden standard for power?

When GFB and BB came out, it changed a good amount of builds, as suddenly several single attack builds got a large power boost, such as arcane trickster or temptest cleric. However SCAG isn't the most known book. If you're actually reading this comment, chance is that you care way too much about 5e and homebrewing. I can't assume that is the case for everyone that sees this on the top of their reddit page.

* If this cantrip reached people that played without SCAG, it would be nice if it didn't change balance, but simply did the thing it was designed to do: Let mace attacks be viable.
* With its low power scaling, Radiant Mark provides melee clerics with a melee option that is a viable choice compared to toll the dead. It simply allows for another playstyle without touching balance too much. If it changed balance, many DM's wouldn't allow this cantrips.
* As it stands, clerics must multiclass or use a feat to gain GFB or BB. GFB and BB are also more powerful than Toll the Dead, since you have a heavy price to acquire the cantrips, their increase in power are kept in check. 
* So yes, Radiant is weaker than BB and GFB, but should they be equal? Radiant Mark (RM) does exactly what I wanted it to do. 
* When you design games and abilities, you don't design them to all be exactly equal. You design them to forfill exact purposes and to encourage the gameplay and play patterns you want from the players. 
* While it is intuitive that RM should be equal in power to the other cantrips, that actually works against my design goals. - as it boosts the powerlevel of the Spirit guardian heavy armor build for clerics. 
* Note that my design goals for my home game and for a reddit post is different, which is why I'm doing the good scaling myself.


So when you choose which one you want in your game. You should consider what impact you want it to make. What you want the new cantrip to encourage, or make viable/more powerful. You shouldn't consider: ""this cantrip should be exactly as powerful as other cantrips like it"".",UnearthedArcana,Radiant Mark. A cantrip to make melee clerics viable,Spell

Tips for using Minor Mishap

\- You can kind of attempt to use this spell on the sly before combat breaks out, and then trigger it to give your foes an immediate disadvantage

\- Prone is one of the weakest conditions to inflict on a foe on their turn, because they will virtually always just stand straight back up. However, if you manage to use this once the foe has expended half their movement, it can be incredibly effective. Wait for the perfect moment, and then mess em up.

I have made some small changes to the shaman class based on feedback that i have gotten. This time, there have only been a few changes, primarily to the Shaman subclasses. I think it's getting close to becoming a well-balanced class.

For any first-time readers, the Shaman is a Wisdom-based Half-caster that uses the Pact Magic feature instead of regular spellcasting and has the option to either use weapons or cantrips effectively.

An explanation of most changes i have made to the class:

# Spell List

I have added some new spells to the shaman spell list, including two new homebrew spells: Spiritual Favor and Wood Hammer. Both homebrew spells are made to primarily benefit the close-range STR-based melee build of the shaman, granting two new close range attack options.

Spiritual Surge is a riff on the Cleric's Spiritual Weapon, granting you a bonus action attack, but the spell centered around you and has a 15 feet range from you along with being a saving throw rather than an attack roll.

Wood Hammer is a short range line AoE which creates a tree trunk in its area. Can be used as zone control, but also as a utility spell if you for some reason need a 30-foot long tree trunk.

# Base Class

Fleeting Soul has been reworked, now improving the character's ability to be revived by other creatures instead of granting a free revive once a few weeks.

The temporary hit points gained from the Natural Barrier feature has been increased to 3d6 to slightly improve the survivability of the Shaman Class.

# Subclasses

Calling of the Sigil has been reworked. Most significant change is the Sealed Magic subclass feature, which grants you the limited ability to cast any shaman spell you have prepared as a pseudo-ritual (casting the spell at lowest level without expending spell slot, increase casting time by 10 minutes). The subclass expanded spell list have also been reworked to accommodate this new subclass feature.

The Occultist is, to me, the collection of oddities - mystical loose ends that rolled out from the class structure of 5e. The binding glue of the Occultist is the tradition, ritual, and mysticism behind their magic. Occultist rituals mix belief, spirituality, and arcane magic into a unique blend. Witches, Shamans, and Oracles are all things I knew I wanted for my game and didn't have them.

The image gallery is missing some spells due to max image limitations, but those missing pages can be found in the GMBinder or PDF versions. This is my first time trying an image gallery post, so hopefully nothing has gone horribly wrong.

#### Why one class for Witches, Shamans, and Oracles?

In various editions and spin offs, Oracles, Witches, and Shamans are all things that could be called a class, and I've certainly seen some people go that route. I think that's fine, but I also think that 5e tends have classes as broader umbrellas - I could certainly write any number of subclasses for each of those, but I think there's enough thematic binding between the classes that they reasonably fit into one class. I think it's generally a lot easier for DMs to add one class that will bring in Witches, Shamans, and Oracles rather than trying to bring in all these new separate classes.

Of course, as a ""Kibbles' Class"", it's fair to say that the class itself is somewhat more subclass based than PHB classes tend to be; I think that's necessary as these classes end up being bigger umbrellas to catch a wider range of the remaining ideas that people want to play.

#### Why do we need a class at all?

There is a world in which these could be subclasses - Shaman perhaps under Cleric, Witch perhaps under Wizard, Oracle perhaps under Sorcerer... but ultimately that'd leave the ideas bereft of much of their potential. All of them are classes that heavily benefit from the the Invocation-like-Rite system, as they are ideas players might want to explore in multiple directions. I find making a flexible and modular class that encompasses all of them to be something of the middle ground to making each its own class vs. making these a more constrained subclass of an existing class, shackled by its design limitations.

#### Is this balanced and ready to go?

It's not perfect yet. If I'm being honest, I usually recommend that around the 1.3 version of classes is when they are enough water under the bridge and have been tested by enough munchkins that I think they are safe for pretty much all games. That said, I think as long as you go in with the idea that it's going to mostly balanced, it'll be mostly balanced. Oracle is definitely the newest and most raw - it's heavily revised from playtesting over these last few weeks, and the new design is fleshed out, but that means it's had less chance for polish and playtesting.

I playtest my content quite a bit, and am lucky to have many others that give me a hand there. This is no exception, but it is the newest and least tested of my classes :)

#### Why Wisdom?

I think it's the best fit, really. Witches could go Int or Wisdom, Oracles could go Charisma or Wisdom, Shamans are pretty squarely Wisdom. Oracle I leaned toward Wisdom to keep them more distinct from Divine Soul Sorcerers (which share a bit of what was traditionally the Oracles design space). For Witch I just feel that the focus on ritual, tradition, and spirituality fit better into Wisdom than Intelligence. I considered making each subclass a variable casting stat, but i'll leave that to DMs and alternate features as after more thought I felt Wisdom was the best stat, and the stat that felt the most needed. While there are several Wisdom casters, I feel Druids are more often than not necessarily played as a caster so much, leaving Clerics to hold the Wisdom front sort of on their own, so adding another Wisdom class to the roster fit in well. While Intelligence was once underrepresented, the Artificer (either my version or the Eberron version) and the Psion both give another Intelligence class to round out the roster there.

I love dwarves and so I put this together, modeling it off the half-elf player race. You get the (admittedly powerful) ASI's of the half-elf, but Charisma is swapped for Constitution. You keep the *Dwarven Resilience* trait, and get a modified version of the dwarven tool proficiencies with the *Master Craftsman* ability. The option to gain expertise from a race is new, but it's limited to artisan's tools so I don't think it's that strong.

(This is a reupload; the first upload was taken down last night for a formatting error.)

The Hierophant is a charismatic religious figure who typically leads a flock of devout followers. A golden masque hides their face, as well as their motivation, allowing them to command without the shackles of a previous identity. A Hierophant can perform genuine miracles, doubtlessly, but some question whether the miracles are the result of a pact with the Upper Planes... or the Lower.

The Hierophant slowly builds \*piety\* throughout a fight, allowing it to passively eliminate and convert the weakest of those who would destroy it. By itself, the Hierophant can be easily KO'd by a party of level 7 adventurers, so it typically prefers to fight alongside some of its devotees, who are more than willing to lay their lives before their leader.

When the Hierophant successfully converts an enemy, it rarely if ever treats them with cruelty (especially as damage can break the charm), and instead commands new followers as defenders of the faith and traveling evangelicals who spread its divine law to nearby settlements.

When running a Hierophant, the key is maintaining the exciting intrigue surrounding its motives; should the party work alongside it, or destroy it? Does it really serve the God it claims? Is it trying to line its pockets, or really do good for the world? Common actions that a Hierophant may take are gathering tithe for its church, obscuring the whereabouts of recent missing converts, accepting gold offerings to remove curses or illness from the hopeless, or even crusading against a ""rival"" faith — of course, The Hierophant uses its high charisma to create solid excuses against any accusation of wrong-doing. The Hierophant is most commonly found in large cities, but may convert the population of a small hamlet or village as well.

Partially inspired by the Slay the Spire mod of the same name, though this brew introduces its own concepts and aesthetics that build upon the inspiration. I don't think I'll make a full Major Arcana set, but I have an idea for one or two other cards I might make.

The Hierophant can be found in its newest version here, including changes and suggestions I've implemented for your comments here: [https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/\_PhnsoPusv\_f](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/_PhnsoPusv_f)",UnearthedArcana,"Test your party's faith with the Hierophant — cleric, cult leader, or charlatan?

This week, I spent a lot of time outside wearing black clothing and as summer grows closer for the Northern Hemisphere, I was feeling the heat. So as I was prepping to post this week, I thought, what better way to beat the heat than with some cold stuff? Enter, ice items, four magic items to keep things cool at your table.

\- **Uncommon: Pelt of Winter’s Heart.** A great early game item for druids who want to be able to wild shape into winter wolves or to stealthily scout ahead through some cold environments.

\- **Rare: Frozen Fistwraps.** Man, do monks need some more love or what? With these hand wraps, finally your party’s monk can feel what it’s like to have a frost brand-like weapon. Abd the best part, is your barbarian or fighter could pick these up, too.

\- **Very Rare: Glacial Plate.** One of my favorite items, this heavy armor uses my favorite spell, fire shield, to keep you protected while looking cool as Stygia.

\- **Legendary: Brazier of Blizzards.** For years, I’ve had an image stuck in my head of some nature druid starting a blizzard with cold fire. I don’t know if I saw it in a movie or what, but when I sat down to make some ice items, this was the first one and I just had to get it down on paper, and I'm really happy with how it turned out.

Major Savant updates! Back again, and this time I’ve really taken a hard look at the class and all of the critiques, criticisms, suggestions, and hopes for the Savant. The goal is still the same - create an Intelligence-based, *non-magic*, support type Class for *Dungeons & Dragons* 5e.

Before I go further, here are some PDF’s and links:

# The Savant v2.4.0

Big updates for the Savant this time around - found mostly in the Academic Disciplines (subclasses). Every time I share the Savant for feedback the *biggest* comments are always about combat potency and lack of actions/bonus actions/reactions. I think this update does a good job of scratching that itch by improving the Academic Disciplines, and adding a brand new option ***The Archaeologist***!

**Base Savant.** No updates to the base Class this time around!

**Archaeologist.** The shiny new Academic Discipline! Is it overpowered? Is it super lame? I don’t know, and I definitely would like some feedback on this bad boy. The goal was to create an investigative, treasure hunting, field researcher type subclass. Think *Indiana Jones* (Indiana Jones), *Allan Quatermain* (King Solomon’s Mines), *Milo Thatch* (Atlantis), or *Benjamin Gates* (National Treasure)!

You start at 3rd level with “expertise” in Investigation and History, a thematic buff to *Adroit Analysis*, and an extra exotic language. You gain some combat buffs focused on mobility and survivability and the ability to identify items.

As you gain levels you get (7th level) the ability to attune to any magic item, attune over short rests, and add your INT to DEX saves. Then (13th level) you can cripple your marked enemy (blind, deaf, restrain), and finally (17th level) you have an innate resistance to magical damage and effects.

**Naturalist.** Biggest change here was swapping the 3rd and 7th level abilities. I moved *Conservationist* up in order to give the Naturalist a thematic combat buff without having to wait until tier 2 play. You still get the ability to be an awesome nature guide at 7th level. You know what they say, put your own oxygen mask on before helping others!

**Philosopher.** BIG CHANGES! No more “totally not magic” cop-outs for this subclass! At 3rd and 13th levels you learn specific *theorems* that you can use as an action in combat. Their effects are *powerful*, but they are single target and only last one round. Best case scenario you spend your action to remove another creatures action. At 17th level you can risk exhaustion to power-up your *theorems*!

**Physician.** Only minor phrasing/clarification changes here. I’m pretty happy with this subclass.

**Tactician.** (more) BIG CHANGES! You get various *Orders* you can give as your action! Granting an additional attack to an ally, buffing their AC, free repositioning, and STR/CON save/check buffs. Again keep in mind you’re giving up your action to grant this power to an ally!

At 7th you are immune to fear! *”The only thing we have to fear is fear itself!”* Also when you issue an *Order* you can make a weapon attack as a bonus action (I’m helping!). Then at 13th you can issue two *Orders* as an action (three at 17th!), and at 17th you orders grant some temp hit points.

417,g4jzrlb,i0x3y0,"First of all, thanks for taking the time to write this out. I appreciate you taking the time to go through the class! Let me see if I can answer some of your statements.

* **Perfect Recall.** I'm not sure it obviates all knowledge checks, just checks on things you've seen before. Recalling the map of the dungeon after the map was lost, remembering the order of the specific incantation you read about last week, remembering the beliefs of a religion or cult you read about. It doesn't allow you to miraculously know things you didn't know before. This is just a flavor ability allowing you to use the notes you take as a player.

* **Extra Attack.** I went back and forth on giving this class *Extra Attack*, and I ended up putting it in. I agree that thematically it doesn't feel *great* with each subclass, but it's still a back-up option for when you run out of abilities. See my previous postings of the Savant for more logic on this design decision.

* **Mental Refresh.** Good call. I will drop blinded and deafened. Monk's get an ability similar to this at the 7th level, so I think I'll add in the Stunned condition to make it worth waiting until 14th level.

* **Undisputed Genius.** I'll admit I am not in love with this ability, but I am at a loss for how to make this powerful enough to keep up with the things spellcasters get at 20th level. There is a precedent for this type of ability with the Barbarian capstone though, it increases two scores (STR and CON by 4 each to a max of 24).

* **Student of History.** Fixed in the GM Binder version, you know what languages they speak, you don't learn the languages themselves. *""Hey that guy is speaking draconic, I don't know what he's saying but it's definitely draconic.""*

* **Daring Determination.** Free *identify* fits thematically with the class being a delver of secrets and ancient places. Wizards still have every other ritual spell in the game to fall back on. My Cleric ritual casting *identify* never made my Wizard jealous in my Curse of Strahd game.

* **Relic Hunter.** Admittedly, the Archaeologist is the newest subclass so it still has some kinks. The other subclasses all get an improvement to their 3rd level ability at 13th level, so I was trying to find a way to improve upon *Daring Determination*.

* **The Savant having ""no weaknesses"".** It has plenty of weaknesses. It has a d8 hit die and a low AC in comparison to other class. No spellcasting or direct offensive power - you have to rely on your party. The Savant also requires preparation and coordination with your team to be successful. 

* **Naturalist.** The *Player's Handbook* Ranger is widely regarded as a poorly designed, underpowered class and shouldn't be used as a benchmark for homebrew. Personally I've separated it's identity into the Naturalist (seen here with the Savant) and my [Alternate Ranger](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-M7iu19Af89SH2G_5RGa)

* **Student of ____.** The core theme of the Savant is gathering knowledge. The Battle Master's *Know Your Enemy* isn't a primary part of their class's identity. It is for the Savant so that is why it comes earlier.

* **Sapping Theorem.** May be too strong, maybe useless (takes six consecutive rounds of failed saves to kill something?). I'll need to see it in play at my table to make the call (haven't seen it played yet).

* **Dress Wounds.** Keep in mind this is temporary hit points that do not stack. And if the Physician uses only this they can't use their other abilities.

* **Healing Surge.** They do need to expend their hit dice (which if the DM is balancing the challenge of the day properly are a very precious resource). If the game balance is off there are a ton of official features that also benefit.

* **Tactical Commander.** You make some good points here, in the next version every subclass will have limited uses of their abilities (short rest recharge).

* **Strategic Genius.** I think this is fixed by making the commands have a fixed number of uses.",UnearthedArcana,"The Savant (Combat Update!) - A Brilliant, Intelligence-based, non-magic Class!

Hey all, back with an Alternate Sorcerer that actually makes sense! I present to you a (major) update to my Alternate Sorcerer! (After the Ranger) the Sorcerer is regularly mentioned as the least satisfying class for 5e. A low number of spells known, limited metamagic, and not mechanically living up to their themes are popular criticisms. My Alternate Sorcerer seeks to address these concerns and make the Sorcerer *feel* like an innately arcane being.

Here are some nice PDF’s

* [The Alternate Sorcerer on GM Binder](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-M2ZGCOTpShGn-0ruzB5) - *the most up to date!*

# The Alternate Sorcerer!

**Multiclassing, Quick Build, and Class Features.** No changes from the *Player’s Handbook*.

**Spellcasting.** Here’s the big one! I’ll break it down piece by piece.

* **Spell Point Casting Variant.** To make the Sorcerer feel more flexible (and differentiate it from other casters) they are not constrained to spell slots. Instead, they can produce whatever spells they like. Want to only cast 1st-level spells? You’re an innately magical being, go ahead. You aren’t limited by the restrictions that come with having to *learn* to cast magic. You ***are*** magic. (**Note:** I did not add the ‘sorcery points’ from the *Player’s Handbook* Sorcerer into the sorcery point pool, the Alternate Sorcerer gains a short rest recharge feature - Sorcerous Restoration - at 3rd level). Your sorcery points continue to scale (albeit much slower) once you get 5th-level spells. Your high-level spells are taken care of with Mystic Arcanums, but you still get sorc points so you can cast Metamagic’d spells.

* **Spellcasting Focus.** You *are* a spellcasting focus. You still need a free hand to cast spells, so this is mostly for flavor, and makes sorcerers feel really unique.

* **Origin Spells.** A *super* common fix for Sorcerers. I personally believe that *WotC* wishes they could do this (every Sorcerer UA has them and they end up dropped). Two thematic spells per level up to 5th. I went with thematic spells over the more powerful options you see in a lot of homebrew.

**Metamagic.** You learn more Metamagic options sooner, and you can switch one out over a long rest. Metamagic is the Sorcerers “thing” in 5e, you should be able to mix it up a bit more than you currently can.

**Metamagic Options.** I’ve kept all the *Player’s Handbook* options, added in the UA Class Feature Variant options, and added a few options of my own design to keep things fresh and fun. 

**Sorcerous Restoration.** Wizards can recover spell slots once per day on a short rest, Sorcerers (the magical batteries of D&D) should definitely be able to do this! 

**Font of Magic.** At 10th level, you can spontaneously learn new spells (by expending sorcery points and replacing a spell of the same level). Sorcerers have a fairly limited spell list, and the UA Class Feature Variant lets them do this over a long rest, so I don’t think it’s that egregious. (Wizards take a deep breath, you’re still the alpha spellcaster in 5e).

**Mystic Arcanum.** Not the most elegant solution, but this effectively balances the spell point vs spell slot concerns. So you can spam low-level spells, but you can’t create five 9th-level spells per day like you can with the Spell Point Variant ‘as-is’ from the *Dungeon Master’s Guide*. You can still add Metamagic to these bad boys, further differentiating you from the Warlock.

**Metamagic Mastery.** You’re 20th level, you should have a capstone that *feels* like it. Metamagic costs are reduced by 1, and you can apply an unlimited number of Metamagics to any spell. Want to use all 25 of your sorcery points to cast a *quickened, twinned, heightened fireball*?! You’re 20th level and you’re probably only playing this character for one last fight/dungeon. Go wild (magic)!

# But what about _____?!

* ***What about the Official Subclasses?!*** I’ve tweaked the official Sorcerous Origins so they work better with the Alternate Sorcerer - Origin Spells, updated Sorcery Point costs, etc.

* ***Why didn’t you add the original Sorcery Points to the Spell Point pool?!*** Spell Points are more powerful than spell slots, there had to be some compromise. They still scale up (slowly) after 5th-level

* ***This is really broken, have you play-tested it?!*** One of the players at my table is playing one currently (3rd level), and I plan to if/when my current Artificer dies.

* ***Wow this is the greatest thing I’ve ever seen, do you have other homebrew?!*** Why yes I do! I have way too much free time, so I have Classes, Subclasses, and Player Races on [my GM Binder page](https://www.gmbinder.com/profile/laserllama)

IMO the action-recovery with half the pool size works better at encouraging the sorcerer to manage his pool and not just fire off fifths all day.  For the sorcerer, Mystic Arcanum is almost more painfully limiting than it is for the warlock in that it cannot upcast spells, locking this sorcerer out of better Demons and Bestow Curse, AND it cannot gain multiple spells of 6th+ level, which it normally would (even if with spellpoints it couldn't cast 6ths and 7ths at 19th and 20th level.  And the stipulation that this sorc can only swap on level-up means a 20th level sorcerer can permanently lose its 9th level slot by losing the ability to cast Wish (Font of Magic doesn't interface with MA as written).  You've also removed the spellpoints from those 6th and 7th slots, but haven't granted a second MA to replace them (20th SP with the 6th and 7th in points would be 133-(13+11+10+9) = 90, I believe), so this sorcerer is notably weaker than baseline.

IMO you shouldn't call it Spellcasting if it doesn't merge with other Spellcasting features - how do you calculate the number of slots vs points you get?

Not getting SP added to the pool hurts a lot at low levels, and doesn't much change the power level at higher ones, especially since this sorc's refresh scales up with level.  If anything, I'd want it balanced the other way around, because after 9th level any spellpoint sorc can cast 5ths all day long.",UnearthedArcana,The Alternate Sorcerer (Updated!) - Become the Source of Arcane Power you were Meant to Be!

422,g10jquq,i78e3u,">**Mystic Arcanum.** Not the most elegant solution, but this effectively balances the spell point vs spell slot concerns. So you can spam low-level spells, but you can’t create **five 9th-level spells per day like you can with the Spell Point Variant ‘as-is’ from the** ***Dungeon Master’s Guide***. You can still add Metamagic to these bad boys, further differentiating you from the Warlock.

Except you can't.  I don't know why people keep thinking this is the case.  The wording is pretty clear on the matter.

Per DMG288...

>Spells of 6th level and higher are particularly taxing to cast.  You can use spell points to create one slot of each level of 6th or higher.  You can't create another slot of the same level until you finish a long rest.

You can just use the stock spell points just fine.  It's what I do in my own [sorcerer rework](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/aESfqWWJc).  (I should really get around to posting the latest version in its own thread...)

Generally, it looks like we approach it pretty much the same way, although you've made sorcerers regain on short rests where I gave them more mana points to begin with.  I can see the merits of both.  Numerically, my solution and yours are essentially identical.  As a rule, I think short rests are good for the game, but I'm not sure it's worth the complexity.

I've also kinda drifted away from the idea of subclass spell lists for the sorcerer.  I'd rather double-down on metamagic, which is part of why I don't do short rest regen.  The larger the spell list, the more diffused a sorcerer becomes.  It's not that I worry about them encroaching on wizards, it's just that I'm afraid they'll lose themselves.

**Metamagic Commentary**

* Delayed: What's the use case here?  I'm not opposed, just curious.
* Kinetic/Warped/Willful: I'm not sure how useful Warped and Willful will be, but Kinetic definitely has its uses.
* Tenacious: honestly, I'd rather this just be a thing you can *do* with sorcery points.  Need to make a conc check?  Burn n sorcery points to add your CHA to the roll.  Needing to specify like this seems wasteful.
* Unstable: I don't think people will take this one.  It's randomness for its own sake, to the point that you can cause the spell to fail.",UnearthedArcana,The Alternate Sorcerer (Updated!) - Become the Source of Arcane Power you were Meant to Be!

This is actually another offshoot of working on crafting. Common items. I've used them here and there in my games, but I've generally been of the opinion that they will almost never actually be good. Ball Bearings and Caltrops have the issue that if a creature treats them as difficult terrain, it can ignore the effect, making their effect really just boil down to creating some difficult terrain... which is neat, but very rarely a good investment. I wanted to offer some more options on how to use it.

Alchemical Fire and Acid just needed more damage and more options in how to use them, and more base damage. Finesse makes sense with throwing them, they are a light objects you cannot even throw very far, and I wanted to give the option of incorporating them in the attack action to make them useable by a broader arrange of folks. They a resource you're expending that should probably be a little better than just a weapon hit.

Oil is just a little weird in the RAW rules, so I wanted to clean it up, add dice to it's damage, and that sort of thing.

Lastly I wanted a feat that'd make specializing in using these pay off.

The big things here are two new subclasses - Wandering Mind answers the long awaited call for a Nomad, and Elemental Mind brings a subclass that starts off with a bang, harnassing the power of Psychokinetics.

Of course, there's been a very useful survey and copious individual feedback from playtesters since the last version, so there's been plenty of small tweaks and changes to add - rebalancing, adjusting a few numbers, and bringing a few things in line, as well as adding some of the popularly requested options to talents. Your feedback and input are what shapes these classes, and I always appreciate what people have to say.

I rely on the support of the good folks on my [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/KibblesTasty). The big and heartfelt thanks to everyone that helps make this possible there. It means the world to me right now.

While Soul Knife is pretty solid right now and not getting any more changes here, Psychic Warrior will be revised shortly.

This is a class that is built overtime by the feedback, playtesting, and ideas of all who contribute. If you find something that seems too strong, have a good idea you'd like to see it, or just want to talk about your experience and character about, I'm always happy to listen.

### Change Log 1.3
* Wandering Mind (Nomad) added to [Expanded Options](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LvvFPhE7BCvj6PEeMsQ)
* Elemental Mind (Kineticist) added to [Expanded Options](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LvvFPhE7BCvj6PEeMsQ)
* 4 new spells and 5 new talents added to the [Expanded Options](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LvvFPhE7BCvj6PEeMsQ)

##### Awakened
* Full Awakening cost reduced to 2, but it no longer gives advantage on ability checks (now saving throws + attack rolls rather than *foresight*).

##### Unleashed
* Rampage now reduces to a d6 if it runs more than a minute (until you complete a short or long rest)
* Uncontrollable Mind now kicks in at a d8 rampage.
* Changed 14th level ability. It is now Unstoppable Rampage, and lets you roll your rampage die against damage that would take you to zero to stay up.

##### Transcended
* Clarified the RAI of Balance of Power. It now clarifies you can add the damage to *one* target of a damage roll (you cannot increase the damage to all targets of a fireball for example by your Psion level).
* Perfected Enhancement is now rounded up (so +3 would add 2 and +5 would add 3).

##### Disciplines
* Telepathy: Removed double on Telepathic Intrusion, replaced by Meddling
* Overwhelming upgraded to stunning (instead of blinding) but had the cost increased to 3 points.
* Transposition: Changed Vanishing to blurring; similar effect but causes less confusion if it can be used for permanent out of combat invisibility after level 5 (it cannot).
* Pyschokinetics: Reduced the cost of Massive Elemental Blast from 3 to 1 for 15 feet, 2 for 30 foot cone, and 3 for 60 foot cone.
* Animate Objects removed from Telekinesis alternate effects.
* Telekentic weaponry now reduces the range to 15 if a weapon has the heavy *or special* property. This is to close the lance loophole.

##### Talents
* Added Mind Thrust Talent (turns Telekinetic Intrusion into an attack roll).
* Kinetic Slam and Mind Thrust wording tweaked; they can now critically strike on a 20.
* Psionic Defenses changed to 13 + Intelligence (from 10 + Dexterity + Intelligence).
* Physical Surge once more lasts for 1 turn instead of 1 minute. Builds that want to use other bonus action powers can opt to focus a physical stat with the other changes and talents in place.
* Perfect Focus changed to -5 from disadvantage, and failing by 5 or more makes you lose both concentration effects. This is to prevent it from being too easy with advantage on concentration checks, as well as to make it harder to automatically succeed concentration checks while using it in general. Perfect Focus must be a debilitating effect to not break the game.
* Hallucination talent removed. Folded into the base telepathic intrusion power under the modifier ""meddling"".

##### Spells
* Mind Blast now only lasts for 1 turn, ending at the end of their turn (rather than until they save). This ability was originally intended to mirror the Mind Flayer ability, but ultimately proved too potent in it's current form. The previous version was ultimately too close to Psychic Scream, a 9th level spell.
* Flicker now just grants resistance on a 2 to all damage (Rather than just non-magical damage).

### Expanded Options Change Log 1.3
##### Subclasses
* Wandering Mind (Nomad) added
* Elemental Mind (Kinectics) added.

##### Talents
* Unchecked Power revised.
* Precise Power revised.
* Added Enhanced Regrowth
* Added Beam of Annihilation
* Removed Mental Reach (was redundant with the feat Psionic Sniper).
* Added Elemental Penetration
* Projected Weapon buffed and revamped.
* Added Tantrum

##### Spells
* Added Shockwave.
* Added Beam of Annihilation
* Added Inner World.

This is a little side project I decided to formalize a little bit, and is generally the jumping off point for making an encounter that your players will hate love. That your players will love. Definitely that. Well, at least they tend to be memorable.

This actually harkens back to some of the older and stranger monsters in D&D that have largely been made more standard in 5e, but sometimes old tools are the best tools when you want to mix things up. Monsters that simply cannot be felled by normal means, or are at least extremely difficult to take down. The last vestiges of this sort of thing in 5e are Werewolves, Vampires, Trolls, Hydras, Rakshasa, and the like, but all those creatures have two real problems: one, they are a victim of their own success and most players can make an educated guess what their weakness is, and, and two, they usually just don't go far enough and often end up just falling down to brute force anyway.

While there will always be room for a monster-by-monster boutique creation experience for each monster, the following is a more holistic approach that provides some consistent mechanics and tables for creating a monster that'll be a memorable encounter.

Welcome back to another installment of Flashpoint Friday! I had a ton of fun talking with everyone about my [Elemental Spells](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/i5dojk/allowance_elemental_plate_and_thunderhead_three/) last week. If you liked them, please be aware that I made a fair amount of changes to the [gmbinder](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MDboWU2Y_8nA3j0xwlw) file based on the feedback.

I think many of us go through a stage in life where we wish we could live forever. And now, more than any time in my life at least, there’s a lot of reminders that we can’t. Thankfully, we have this beautiful game to escape into. And what a pleasure it would be to live in the world we create for each other forever. To do it, I give you the Arcane Tradition: Immortality!

There’s no official 5e support for how to build a phylactery. Hundreds if not thousands of DMs have had to homebrew ways of doing it for their players, referencing other editions, posting here, whatever. But that doesn’t even cover the fact that a lot of players whose characters want to live forever don’t want to be liches! All that consuming souls business is a little edgy.

The Immortality Wizard does it a different way. By stealing some of the secrets of clerics and learning how to prolong the body with arcane healing and augmented transmutations, Immortality wizards push their bodies to the very brink of immortality, and then they find a way to preserve their souls without a phylactery. They *fireball* with the best of them, but when those fireballs get a little close for comfort, they might throw up *expeditious retreat* to get out of dodge with a little extra boost from their Liberated Anatomy.

Its been a while!

I tried to lean more into this concept for this subclass, which takes some features from the original, but has a unique playstyle that allows you to manipulate the vision of your foes, and keeps them guessing as to what is real, and what is just a shadow.

I hope you enjoy the subclass, and be sure to let me know what you think in the comments. :)

Taking a watch is by far the most common action in most adventuring groups, but when it's unncessary (or you are feeling bold) here's some additional options to fill the void - Cooking, Preparation, and Slumbering (extra sleep!) are all popular options :)

These are not power neutral, as generally some of the options will allow your players to get a little more out of their long rest... but there's also an opportunity cost to not being as diligent taking their watches that cost far more than any of the rewards, so there's certainly a risk and reward to it in some cases (though when resting in a safe place, it's mostly just reward... which is an added benefit as it encourages players to rest in safe places!)

* This system has many branches; I've previously posted Blacksmithing, and this is Alchemy. Enchanting, Scrollcraft, Cooking and Tinkering are all in progress in various states; it'll be awhile after this before anything else is posted, but if you want to preview any of those, they are my patreon at the $1 tier as the master doc for the WIP crafting system.

* Personally I don't use the pricing listed. These prices have been adapted to be compatible with games running more standard PHB/DMG gold values than I use, and from the feedback so far are a reasonable adaption, but personally I use a much more compressed system.

* [New Disclaimer] This has some instances where I've used my own version of something marked via ^K^; you can feel free to replace this with the default version if you'd like, the balance assumptions would be the same. I ran a poll if people would rather it use strictly RAW items, or include new and revised items, and people voted for new and revised items, so that's what it does.

The following is an introduction to my crafting system, which is the same as with the blacksmithing post (well, besides a few typo fixes and the like):

____ 

## Why do you need Crafting?
Some people may wonder - why do you need a crafting system? Isn't that what loot is for? The truth is, in some games, that's true. Not every adventurer is going to want to pursue crafting. But with a crafting system, not only can you craft what you need without finding it in a dragon hoard, what you find in that dragon hoard can be so much more.

In a game with a robust crafting system, there is no junk, there is just more opportunities and fresh possibilities. A +1 shortsword that no one can use could be the valuable basis of a new spear. Gems, gold, relics, and recyclables... all valid entry points for the crafters creativity. 

Adventurers are inherently innovative folks on a quest for creative solutions to difficult problems. Crafting gives them that toolbox.

So... why do you need crafting? You don't. But you should probably want it.

### Who can craft?
Anyone! Who can succeed in making something useful? Perhaps a bit of a different story. Crafting is not inherently tied to class, though in some cases some classes may give benefits to it (like Artificer); crafting may come from your background in the form of a tool proficiency, or it may be something you learn during your adventures following the old adage of necessity being the mother of invention.

Crafting is mostly about the time, effort, knowledge and materials. As such, most of crafting is knowing the recipe and having the time and materials needed... but a skilled craftsman works quicker and is more successful, and in this business practice makes perfect, so there are various progression modifiers that apply. Your DM can determine if your background would merit starting your adventure with any, otherwise guidelines for how to gain them are included.

### What can I craft?
Anything! But this guide is made by a mere mortal, and is thus limited in scope. This guide will provide the principles of crafting for many fields - from alchemy to engineering to woodworking. 

The basis of how crafting works is similar between each field, but the recipes, material, and most important results will be radically different... After all, a healing potion, a catapult, and a magic sword are all things you can craft, but the process for each varies quite a bit.

The goal of this document is teach you how to get started, and provide the basics that will get you a long way into your adventure, but not make a complete codex of everything that could potentially be crafted. When you hit something that doesn't appear in this document, just reference the closest items and make a bit of a leap to what extra steps might be needed to realize your vision into your D&D world!

### A Player Driven System
One of the fundamental goals and inspirations of the crafting system is to make it a player driven system. It is a system where the player can say ""**I** would like to harvest the monster for ingredients"" and ""**I** would like to forage as we go through the forest looking for alchemy reagents"" and ultimately ""**I** would like to make a healing potion"" and all those rules can be exposed in a PHB like style to the player. The DM still adjudicates many instances of them, but the ideal is to have a system in which the DM does not have to handcraft every instance of gathering materials and crafting.

### Hooking Your Players In
On the other hand, if the DM wants to get the players into it, there are some tools they can use. By far the most effective tool is to give the players reagents as part of loot that don't have an obvious place to sell them. If you give players 2 curative reagents, they are going to start looking into how they can use those, as they'd much rather have a healing potion.

If you want to go one further though, if you give them *5* curative reagents and they realize they will have a remainder of one... then they start looking into ""Well, how do we get a 6th!""

### Depth and Complexity
This system has two goals: to be simple and easy to use, and to be deep and extensible. Naturally these are somewhat at odds, and accomplished by having a great deal of optional depth. To produce standard items with standard effects, the process for finding or buying the materials and using them to make what you want to make will be straightforward. However, it always allows a degree of customization and specificity for those that look further. Whipping up a potion of healing is fairly easy, but you can also delve into the custom potions and brew something entirely unique.

How much of the detail you want to engage with as a DM can be easily adjusted by how you hand out reagents. By sticking to the standard ingredients and using their generic names, the materials are no more complicated than handing out gold or other rewards (and can even be fully converted easily to a gold based system if you want the most simplified version), but if you'd like to have specific ingredient names and exotic ingredients with special effects, those are there for you to pull from.

##### Generic Ingredients
Above and throughout the document, you will see that ingredients are referred to by generic tags like ""common curative reagent"" rather than specific natures. For example, you may harvest magical herbs, and find Kingsbane in the forest, a poisonous plant. For the purposes of crafting, this can be recorded simply as a ""common poisonous reagent"" and used as such in crafting. 

This greatly simplifies the process of crafting and recording what your supplies are. Narratively speaking, a skilled alchemist can render down the ingredients they want to use in the form they need.

Each crafting profession will have some profession wide materials that are used in their recipes - reagents for alchemy, metals for blacksmithing, etc. 

Some very rare and legendary items will have specific ingredients; this is for flavor rather than balance, though is up to your DM.

##### Camp Actions

A recommended complimentary system is the Kibbles Camp Actions which can be found [**here**](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MK0g94rlPq9A0KprEKC) and provide more formalized rules for how to make use of your time during a long rest.

Plus, of course, this will be a central piece of my upcoming book, so this feedback and updates are going to be important coming up! Speaking of that...

### FAQ:

> Is this the version that'll be in the book?

No, this is 2.1, that'll be the 3.0, typically called the OGL version. This class has 3 years of updates and playtesting, but will receive a lot more in the next few months as we go from ""something that is cool for a Reddit post"" to ""something I'm comfortable being printed on a dead tree in a form I cannot easily update!""

> Why does this exist? There's an Artificer in the Eberron book/Tashas!

Because people want to play it! It really is as simple as that. If people had lost interest in it when the official Artificer dropped I would probably have retired it, but conversely, the release of the official Artificer was the biggest spike in new players this version ever saw in a month! This isn't a conversation about one or the other being bad, just about what the expectation of an Artificer is - lot of folks want something more flexible and invention focused, and that's what I'm making here. Realistically they've become parallel things that have little more overlap than a Paladin and Fighter might... occasionally similar themes, but largely just their own things. I'm not here to tell you what you want to play - I'm just here to offer things that people do want to play in a balanced and tested form :)

> This is obviously overpowered.

I'm happy to chat about anything you're concerned by. This has had thousands of playtesters, so most things have been played by someone. You and I may not agree, but perhaps we can come to understanding about why it is the way it is, and what might be the right solution for you if you wanted to use it.

> This is obviously underpowered.

I get this feedback about as much as I get the above. The answer is the same, but with the caveat that this offers a lot of flexibility, and consequently sometimes it lets you build it in a way might not be as effective as you want. I'm always happy to help you figure out a load out that might work for what you want to do.

> A class should not be 40 pages!

Well, my friend, we have some philosophical differences, but I think there is some things to consider here. First of all, a player is not playing 40 pages of the class. They will pick a subclass, and the subclasses, which is a pretty small section of this, and that's all they or the DM really need to worry about in most of the cases. This is a class that aims to give the player an actual path of invention and does not recycle the DMG magic items (for a few reasons) and consequently has to include all of its own features - it'd be like a Wizard including all their own spells :)

Consequently, it's pretty long. If you ever wanted the answer to ""why did WotC not offer subclass specific Warlock invocations?""... now you have it :)

If you ever thought ""damn it would be cool if WotC had offered subclass specific invocations!""... this one is probably for you!

> This has a grammar error. Literally unplayable.

My grammaring is one of my notable weaknesses. You can help fix this in the [copy editing sheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sXm14XZPt8cpuuMOoRwtveuaZvuTHGV_q57ktdduT6U/), or you can wait for me to hire an editor for the Kickstarter version... that's part of the point!

> What's new?

I thought you'd never ask! A lot!

The base rules of 5th edition offer the opportunity for players to spend extra money on more luxurious lifestyles. Players can buy expensive food, sleep in expensive taverns, and otherwise pamper themselves. But with no mechanical benefits for doing so, it can often feel like throwing money away for no reason.

These rules give an opportunity for DMs to reward players for spending their money on luxury, and gives an incentive for players to not stay in the cheapest tavern they can find and eat the cheapest food they can. These rules even work in those campaigns where DMs don't force their players to find food each day or build shelters while in the wild.

The benefits are fairly low-impact, especially given the short duration of their effects, but it will definitely make it more important for players to seek out good food, shelter, and hospitality whenever they are staying in a town.

It's also another form of 'consumable' buffs, like potions or scrolls, but at a much lower price point, so it gives parties a means to prepare for a big quest even if they can't spend hundreds of gold on magic items.

The rules are designed to be agnostic to certain playstyles, but they were influenced by Gritty Realism rest rules, as I personally use those. When an eight-hour sleep is only a short rest, every opportunity to recover hit points and levels of exhaustion are valuable, and players are likely to shell out for such rewards under those circumstances.

The rules are especially significant when paired with other optional rules that punish players for going days without eating, or sleeping without proper shelter or a warm fire during the night, usually with levels of exhaustion. I believe that being rewarded for doing well is just as important as being punished for doing poorly, and these bonuses do well to offset the harshness of failing survival checks in the wilderness.

I am aware that this makes *mordenkainen's magnificent mansion* significantly more powerful, and I'm okay with that, especially given my choice to use Gritty Realism rules, which really hurts the spell. These mechanics also make *heroes' feast* more or less powerful, depending on whether you allow the spell to give these benefits or not.

Please let me know what you think. I use these rules in my own games, but I'm definitely open to suggestions and criticisms.",UnearthedArcana,Rest and Recuperation: rules to reward players for luxurious lifestyles,Mechanic

There have been many attempts at building or homebrewing the dark knight in 5th edition D&D, but while some of them are very cool, I personally feel that none of them have *fully* captured the definitive experience of playing the Batman. My goal here was to wrangle what I believe are the most important aspects of the character's abilities (detective skills, gadgets, fear factor, martial arts, etc.) and put them all into a carefully balanced Roguish archetype. I also made sure that the abilities gained through leveling up reflect those that Bruce Wayne acquires, depending on his level of experience in most stories.

Best used on big AoE spells, where the +5 bonus can be applied to as many creatures as possible.

I originally designed this for a Pyromancer Sorcerer I DMed for once, who absolutely *loved* the item. It's a strong item, but I don't think it's unreasonable. A pyromancer can pretty easily get access to stronger damage boosts - a draconic sorc's ability to add their CHA mod to fire damage is basically equal to the damage boost provided by this ring, except that CHA mod is applied to *every* spell, whereas the bonus damage from this ring will probably only be applied once per fight.

#Version Links & Changelog

[**v3.0**](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/g5g2s6/pyromancers_ring_v3_an_item_for_flame_mages_which/)

* The ring once again requires attunement - it's been signficantly buffed, so I think it warrants attunement, and it also grows with you, so it's not something you'll need to swap out with another attuned item later.

* The maximum number of storable charges has been removed, but you lose all charges when you take a long rest.

* The ring now gains a charge when you use a spell slot, meaning you can't gain charges using Spell Mastery, but you can dump the charges whenever you deal fire damage, meaning the power boost can be applied to cantrips or class features if you wish.

[**v2.0**](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/g162r5/pyromancers_ring_v2_an_item_for_flame_mages_which/)

* The item no longer requires attunement.

* The maximum number of storable charges is now equal to twice your level.

* You now gain a number of charges equal to the level of the spell that was cast.

- I reworked their spell list, removing hold person, haste, etc, but adding some utility spells. They also get 2 of the 3 options, for each level. I tried to keep the spell list small, while still giving a breadth of options and hitting all the iconic jedi powers.

479,greriup,kn26sr,"Thank you for the detailed feedback! I made an updated version with Phylea's help, adjusting and clarifying a few things. Flaming Vortex was meant to hit only a different creature, but I want to run the numbers again to see if is too strong if left as is. I didn't notice before that the secondary damage of GFB requires no save at all. Vortex is primarily intended as a control ability, and I didn't realize its damage potential.

[https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MPmjmq3YijiSzS8pMbP](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MPmjmq3YijiSzS8pMbP)

Some things to consider for DPR: for Burning Brand, it only goes off if the creature successfully deals damage, so damage calculations depend largely on the creature's target's AC. It also doesn't trigger if the creature damages the Warlock, a class that's risky to frontline with. Its meant to be very punishing to a multi-attack creature that chooses to attack a weaker party member while ignoring you.

For Forging Flame, it gets stronger if paired with Thirsting Blade and possible attacks of opportunity or other reaction attacks - which does conflict with stacking more GFB invocations. I think a hybrid focus of GFB + Thirsting Blade + Melee feats would be viable, but not alwalys outshine a melee DPR focused Hexblade. Basically a Warlock built this way would alternate GFB and 2 attacks to keep Forging Flame going.

For both I also considered that fire is less preferred overall as a damage type, while Thirsting Blade does let you have the option of several magical melee and necrotic damage.

I think the big draw for Thirsting Blade is that it can be combined with bonus effects like Hex, Eldritch Smite, Lifedrinker and especially Polearm Master and GWM. My hope was to design a possible alternative to stacking these Feats/Invocations, and then giving some ""tanking"" and utility options for GFB as well.",UnearthedArcana,The Pact Arsenal – an invocation supplement for martial Warlocks.,Feature

482,gi2khxa,kqa20s,"Hello everyone! 

I have been working over the past few months on a lot of content. Too much, some might say (including myself at times). The reason for this is because I have been working diligently on a massive project: my own setting guide. This setting, known as **Yvarra**, has been the primary setting for my home games for years and I am excited to announce that I am making a complete guide for it. This guide, known as **Yorviing’s Guide to Yvarra** will feature a brand new setting filled with [strange and unusual gods and demigods](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MGQEKDQ9U67Wtw7Ql0A), forgotten and ancient magic, and terrifying creatures that lurk in the dark. This setting book will aim to give both players and GMs alike with a wealth of options to run campaigns and stories within Yvarra, and I hope to release a preview of the project soon!

Today I decided to show off one of the wizard subclasses that is going into YGY. Today’s subclass, **Arcane Tradition: Fleshwarping**, is a subclass focused around altering flesh, meat, and bone and mastering a series of new spells that include a special *’fleshwarping’* spell tag. Growing additional limbs, adding eyes and mouths, wearing the flesh of others, and more can be found in this series of spells with this spell tag, which include a mix of new spells created by me and some official spells I thought were thematically appropriate to this spell tag. **Note:** This subclass, and it’s accompanying spells, has a good amount of body horror/grotesque magic, and might not be for those with an easily turned stomach. If you are easily turned by gross depictions of twisting flesh, approach this with caution. 

I decided to keep the artwork a bit more simple on this one, and kept to a more ‘occult’ type of approach to the artwork. 

I hope you are all having a great day, and I hope that everyone enjoys this new subclass — **Arcane Tradition: Fleshwarping** :D

Why 1d4-1? It keeps the potential bonus fairly low, so as to not overshadow players who have intentionally invested in INT or taken proficiency in the associated skill, and the potential for a 0 result represents the fact that no tome could possibly contain knowledge on *all* possible inquiries in a given field. Sometimes, your players will want to look into something for which there are no notes in the notebook.

489,ge8vphl,k4i5pe,"So, off the top a few disclaimers:

* This is the a pre-1.0 version, and there will be errors and mistakes. I am doing my best, but crafting has been challenging project in scope, and as each edition flips by a ton of tables need to be updated and moved around (and those that follow me regularly know my spelling and grammar leaves something to be desired at the best of times). I will keep polishing it in future versions. If you want a professionally edited version... that's what the Kickstarter is for.

* This is just the blacksmithing branch of the system. There is currently an Intro, Blacksmithing, Alchemy, and Poisoncraft, with Cooking, Tinkering, Scrollcraft and Enchanting in progress (some are minor branches, some are major branches). The whole system isn't quite ready yet, but you can [preview what exists](https://www.patreon.com/posts/crafting-0-3-bit-44358630) at even given time at the $1 tier of my patreon.

* I don't use PHB pricing in my games. I find it ridiculous. By popular demand I have converted this to my best approximation of PHB pricing warping it just enough to try to make it more or less make sense, but there might be a few oddities there.

With that out of the way... Crafting! The following is, well, some snippets of the Introduction:

### Why do you need a Crafting?
Some people may wonder - why do you need a crafting system? Isn't that what loot is for? The truth is, in some games, that's true. Not every adventuring is going to want to pursue crafting. But with a crafting system, not only can you craft what you need without finding it a dragon hoard, what you find in that dragon hoard can be so much more.

In a game with a robust crafting system, there is no junk, there is just more opportunities and fresh possibilities. A +1 shortsword that no one can use could be the valuable basis of a new spear. Gems, gold, relics, and recyclables... all valid entry points for the crafters creativity. 

Adventurers are inherent innovative folks on a quest for creative solutions to difficult problems. Crafting gives them that toolbox.

So... why do you need crafting? You don't. But you should probably want it.

### A Player Driven System
One of the fundamental goals and inspirations of the crafting system is to make it a player driven system. It is a system where the player cans say ""**I** would like to harvest the monster for ingredients"" and ""**I** would like to forage as we go through the forest looking for alchemy reagents"" and ultimately ""**I** would like make a healing potion"" and all those rules can be exposed in a PHB like style to the player. The DM still adjudicates many instances of them, but the ideal is to have a system in which the DM does not have handcraft every instance of gathering materials and crafting.

### Hooking Your Players In
On the other hand, if the DM wants to get the players into it, there are some tools they can use. By far the most effective tool is to give the players reagents as part of loot that don't have an obvious place to sell them. If you give players 2 curative reagents, they are going to start looking into how they can use those, as they'd much rather have a healing potion.

If you want to go one further though, if you give them *5* curative reagents and they realize they will have a remainder of one... then they start looking into ""Well, how do we get a 6th!""

### Depth and Complexity
This system has two goals: to be simple and easy to use, and to be deep and extensible. Naturally these are somewhat at odds, and accomplished by having a great deal of optional depth. To produce standard items with standard effects, the process for finding or buying the materials and using them to make what you want to make will be straight forward. However, it always allows a degree of customization and specificity for those that look further. Whipping a potion of healing is fairly easy, but you can also delve into the custom potions and brew something entirely unique.

How much of the detail you want to engage with as a DM can be easily adjusted by how you hand out reagents. By sticking to the standard ingredients and using their generic names, the materials and no more complicated than handing out gold or other rewards (and can even be fully converted easily to a gold based system if you want the most simplified version), but if you'd like to specific ingredient names and exotic ingredients with special effects, those are there for you to pull from.

##### Generic Ingredients
Above and throughout the document, you will see that ingredients are referred to by generic tags like ""common curative reagent"" rather than specific natures. For example, you may harvest magical herbs, and find Kingsbane in the forest, a poisonous plant. For the purposes of crafting, this can be recorded simply as a ""common poisonous reagent"" and used as such in crafting. 

This greatly simplifies the process of crafting and recording what your supplies are. Narratively speaking, a skilled alchemist can render down the ingredients they want to use in the form they need.

Each crafting profession will have some profession wide materials that are used in their recipes - reagents for alchemy, metals for blacksmithing, etc. 

Some very rare and legendary items will have specific ingredients; this is for flavor rather than balance, though is up to your DM.

##### Camp Actions

A recommended complimentary system is the Kibbles Camp Actions which can be found [**here**](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MK0g94rlPq9A0KprEKC) and provide more formalized rules for how to make use of your time during a long rest.

____

This is just the beginning of a grand journey! Crafting is one of the three pillars of what I up to include in the upcoming Kickstarter (Artificer, Psion, & Crafting) and of those Crafting is the one that I'll be working on the most, as it's the one that doesn't fully exist right now. That means there's rough spots, but it also means that you can have an impact on it - what would you like to craft that's not here yet?

Somethings that will definitely be added:

* More material modifiers.

* More crafting modifiers.

* Expanded item lists.

What else would you like to see?

**What do you want to forge that it doesn't let you craft? Tell me your crafting hopes and dreams and lets see if we can make them come true :)**

PS: It was an executive decision to call Blacksmith's Tools as Blacksmithing Tools because Blacksmith's Tools drives me up the wall. What will be will be on that one.

- I think the invulnerability language should be something like ""cannot be targeted or subject to unwanted effects, including damage"" as a catchall to avoid issues with AOE uses of frighten effects, mass teleports, etc. 

- I think it's perfectly okay to shield a familiar this way and (provided the incapacitated restriction is used) Help doesn't need to be specified as harmful. A safe Help action is fairly normal WITHOUT a feat.

- I do think the warm fuzzies are a touch strong and also might undesirably incentivize LOTS of friends over ONE very beloved friend. There are many ways to retune this; mine of preference would be something like ""when you complete a long rest with a friendly Tiny creature you interact with for at least an hour (this can be done alongside any other activities) you gain a number of warm fuzzies equal to your proficiency bonus, which you can spend..."" etc.

- I think this feat is fantastic design space.

The changes to the intimidation should mitigate the powerlevel you can attain this way. The damage you'd dish out this way still wouldn't be superior to most other classes leading up to 10th level. You're delaying additional sneak attack damage, spell slot progression for smites, ability score improvements AND extra attack. You'd get to the damage other martials can do at 5th level around level 8, never have your bonus action ready and pull ahead only against single enemies. So yes you'd be a really strong nova damage dealer at level 8-10 up, which you could be earlier already if you'd single classed.

It would be an immense investment and comes online at a time where statistically most campaigns come to an end.

First, I have a tumblr now! You can find me at [**rain-junkiednd.tumblr**](https://rain-junkiednd.tumblr.com/), if you want to follow me more directly. I post my homebrew a few hours earlier over there than I do here, and also share some of my older work on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

I’m super excited to bring y’all the long awaited update to my Dragon Knight class. For those of you wondering about the changes since v7, you can find a changelog [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zZHLcfmDXvcnZYyewzDm9vk1YSP3hLwF/view). While this is technically a v8 of a class, I’ve rewritten nearly every feature from the ground up, to help clean up a lot of the wording (which was two years old, yikes), and help cut down on space. I basically consider it a v2 of the class, and each other version was 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.

One thing you might immediately notice is that **the Valiant Practice is not included in this version of Dragon Knight**. I chose not to include Valiant Practice in this release, as I wanted to spend more time bringing it up to more modern homebrewing standards. It was, by far, one of the clunkiest Dragon Knight subclasses, and I just need more time to develop it, but also wanted to bring you the rest of the finished product as soon as possible. Players who are still using the Valiant Practice can continue to use the subclass in v7 with the class updates in v8, and you can expect an updated Valiant Practice to be released sometime in November.

Thank you for all your support and feedback over the years, even today I still get messages from people asking questions about a DK update, or telling me about their characters (which I absolutely love to get). V7 of the class currently has 55,264 views on GM Binder as of this post, and I hope you all continue to enjoy playing the class as much as I enjoyed writing it!

I don’t expect any major updates to the class going forward, bar any broken mechanics that have slipped in that I missed, but I also said that when I posted v7, so maybe we can expect to see DKv9 in 2 years time, haha! Links are below, including a printer friendly version of the class.

[October Release Schedule](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/476404668910665750/759707273500426250/OctoberReleaseDK.png), next week is the Sniper, followed by some spooky subclasses as we get closer to Halloween!

This is the 2.0.2 update for Kibbles' Alternate Artificer.

### High Level Summary of Changes:

* Potionsmith Adrenaline rush builds have been rebalanced.

* Thundersmith weapons have been tweaked, particularly for non-Thundersmiths.

* Fleshsmith Thesis has been tweaked a fair bit based on playtesting and feedback.

* The [**Expanded Toolbox**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mWGy3HXabPNRaGVimZU5GctVVvwQDpCi) has been updated. The new dark Cursesmith is available in it's preview/beta version!

### Frequently Asked Questions:

> *Why does this exist now that the new UA Artificer/Eberron Artificer is different?*

This was originally an update to the old UA Artificer, and when the new UA Artificer went a different direction, it has split off to become it's own thing as that's what people wanted. While I don't hate the new UA Artificer, it's a different beast holding down a different design space, and doesn't quite line up with what Artificers are in the eyes of many players. I left it up to the community if this should be merged or continue on it's own way, and the overwhelming ask was to keep it a separate thing.

> *Why is this nearly 40 pages? Is that necessary?*

Is it necessary? No. Does it make for a fuller experience? Probably. In general, a player will only be using a subsection of this content, something more akin to 4-5 pages. In many ways you can think of the subclasses are more akin to different classes that are bound together by a common root; as 5e design does not really support adding 7 new classes with 1 subclass each.

5e typically does not offer a lot of customization for your class, but there are exceptions - from Battlemasters and their maneuvers to Warlocks and their Invocations - and this expands on those traditions. I feel like if anything is going to have customization, Artificers are probably the place to do it.

> *Is this balanced?*

Every subclass has been playtested by in excess of a dozen people, and the overall class has been played by thousands of people, hundreds of have left thoughts and feedback. I won't make any claim to perfection, but in general I can say that it is balanced, and won't break your game. The design goal for this class was to ensure it was never setting the ""high water mark"" for power. It may out perform various unoptimized builds in terms of dealing damage, but there's always going to be a PHB build that does more damage. Damage is not the only metric of balance and many factors have been considered, but making the Artificer competitive without overwhelming existing options has been a major factor of the design.

> *40 pages of Artificering options.... Is that all?*

Nope, there's also an [**Expanded Toolbox**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mWGy3HXabPNRaGVimZU5GctVVvwQDpCi).

> There's a ton of grammar errors.

That's not a question :(

That said, there are frequently errors, and I do my best to fix what people point out. People from the discord have created a [copy-edit sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sXm14XZPt8cpuuMOoRwtveuaZvuTHGV_q57ktdduT6U/edit#gid=1086610056) to capture the errors, and if it gets added to that sheet, I do go through and fix it, so it's always improving and polishing on the grammar front.

519,fb1f9pg,e8rbvz,"> . One question I have is how the 'Cross-Disciplinary Knowledge' class feature works when combined with other subclass features. For example, if I made a Warsmith and chose the 'Power Fist' Upgrade would I then be able to use the Infused Weapon granted on the Power Fist since it meets all the requirements, thus increasing its hit die to a d10 and allowing intelligence to be used in place of strength?

No; while this would normally work, CDK has the line: 

> You cannot apply Infused Weapon to another weapon granted by this class.

To specifically prevent this. This used to be possible, but was proving too powerful in several instances and was patched out a few versions ago.

> If I had instead chosen the 'Alchemical Fire' Instant Reaction would I be able to add my intelligence modifier to its damage once I reach level 5, as per the 'Empowered Alchemy' feature even though it's not the subclass I chose?

Nope; CDK does not grant subclass features beyond the listed it; for example, taking a Stormforged Weapon would also not give you Thunder monger. The subclass abilities are often enhanced by the subclass; taking them through CDK is generally a weaker version for that reason.

> I also think that the Adorable Critter could maybe be fleshed out (pun intended) a bit more, maybe by adding a level 9 upgrade for it since none exists. I like the idea of making a Dr. Frankenstein-esque character who creates an unstoppable mutating/adapting creature.

Adorable Critter already has a lot of upgrades out of your limited pool, so it's a tricky one, as I wouldn't want to soak up all the upgrades. In general I don't like to go too deep into ""Upgrade Trees"" as those tend to start limiting how much flexibility you actually have (after all, for most of the game you only have a handful of upgrades to play around with).

Adorable Critter line may seem some refinement in the future, if the existing upgrades end up getting collapsed a bit new upgrades might be able to expand it, or I might add something more to the expanded toolbox for it.

> Aside from that, I am astounded by the detail and refinement that has gone into the class and I eagerly await more of your work.

Always glad to hear. The Artificer updates a bit slower these days, but I'm sure there's more coming, particularly for the Expanded Toolbox (Cursesmith is on it's early days here).

\-Frozen Blood: removed the extra HP.

Welcome back to another installment of Flashpoint Friday! I had a great time showcasing my [Magic Weapons for Spellcasters](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/ii7084/magic_weapons_for_casters_four_magic_items_that/) last week. If you liked them, please be aware that I made some updates to the [gmbinder](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MFX94pjxc2AtE0SVZjW) file.

As we come to the end of another month of Flashpoint Fridays, I'm really excited to return to spells. For almost a year now, I’ve been playing in a campaign that has largely been set in the desert. Two sessions ago, though, we began heading out of the vast desert, and I’ve got to say, I was a little sad to leave it. It’s a beautiful and intelligent setting, and when I was thinking about what spells I wanted to make this week, I knew I wanted some to bring the nostalgia I’m feeling for the desert. So here they are:

**Conjure Worm.** I’ve always felt that a 9th level *conjure celestial* spell was super underwhelming. I mean, the DMG recommends that a 9th level spell deal between 82 and 98 damage per turn, depending on if that damage is against one target or spread to multiple. You know what’s expected to do 83 damage per turn? A purple worm. And just imagine the madness. The BBEG lich caster gets desperate and BAM! Purple Worm. Or maybe the party cleverly gathers multiple bad guys into the same area and the wizard just unleashes pure chaos on them. Either way, it meets all my Dune fantasies.

**Sands of Time.** The image of a player disintegrating into sand and then reappearing where they were before was stuck in my head the entire time I was making this spell. I can’t even tell you how many different ways I played with making that image come to life. Finally, I decided on a lower-level version of *far step*, restricted to spaces you’ve already been. Given that this costs an action instead of a bonus action and has the restriction, I think it fits 3rd-level and gives players a fun thing to think about strategy-wise. Where was I standing? Where have I moved? 

**Thirsting Oasis.** Definitely my favorite of these spells, *thirsting oasis* creates the illusion of freshwater and respite. You create a huge area of effect, which can pull in so many. The crowd control possibilities on this are enormous. And it’ll teach some of those enemies not to dump Intelligence as they waste their turns scooping water from an imaginary lake with their hands and fail to drink it.

\--

Anyway, I hope you like these! As always, I’m open to constructive criticism, so please let me know what you think. Also, feel free to grab the pdf from [gmbinder](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MFgIoprVUUKwMPwRNHJ) if you’d like and give me a follow on reddit if this resonates.

I know the Demon hunter has couple takes out there, though I didn't like them (obviously), and I am aware that unlike my warden class, this doesn't fill the same type of niche within the class options, but I made it this far, so I should work on it further.

*Imprint Soul: Now allows you to keep up to 5 drawings in your Book of Shadows.*

*Inverted Gaze: Now only tells you whether a creature is looking at you, NOT where that creature is. The prerequisites have been removed to reflect this weaker version of the invocation.*

*Living Map: Now only requires that you see the entire area that you want to draw, not occupy every space. It also allows you to draw areas smaller than a 40-foot square if you so choose.*

*Mired Step: Now only affects hostile creatures.*


Hello Adventurers!

I’ve decided to post a new homebrew every week in an effort to raise money for the International Medical Corps. Here’s post #19!

Eldritch Invocations

For these invocations, my main goal was to expand on pact-specific invocations, improving the combat potential of Chain and Blade Warlocks, while giving Tome Warlocks even more versatility and utility. I’m also of the general opinion that you can never have enough invocations. Please let me know if you have any comments, balance concerns, or critique on how I can improve these invocations!

If you like what you see or if you’re just feeling generous, please consider donating to the International Medical Corps. They’re a global humanitarian organization that both provides direct medical assistance to areas in need and helps those areas develop their own healthcare systems. You can learn more about their mission [here.](https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/what-we-do/) They’re pretty busy right now, so I thought this would be a good way to help them out. If you can donate something, great! If you can’t right now, that’s fine too! Please enjoy the Eldritch Invocations either way :)

541,gbnykmz,jqm406,"Hey all! So after a bit of a hiatus, I am back with an update to my Alternate Ranger! (I know, nobody has ever attempted this before have they?). Short version: this is an attempt to have the mechanics of the Ranger match the fantasy in a *satisfying* way. I’ve based this (loosely) on the power scaling of the Paladin, incorporated the best of homebrew fixes, UA: CFV, and my own ideas.

Here are some nice PDF links:

# The Alternate Ranger!

**Flavor text, Multiclassing Requirements, and Quick Build.*** Nothing too new or shocking here, though I do let you choose STR or DEX as the requirement for multiclassing (shoutout to all my STRangers out there!)

**Class Features.** No changes. Again, these are fine in the base class.

**Survivalist Knacks.** One of my biggest adjustments to the class, *Knacks* are modeled on the Warlock’s *Eldritch Invocation* system (which is one of the best-designed things in 5e). There are many, many, *many* opinions on what a Ranger should be - Stealthy hunter? Hardy woodsman? Fearless explorer? Guy/gal that has an animal friend?

Knacks let you build your Ranger how *you* want. Based loosely on the abilities granted by the UA: CFV’s *Deft Explorer* ability, this allows you to specialize your Ranger in one area, or become a jack of all trades of the wilderness. This is the first iteration of this feature so balance may not be perfect yet, but I wanted to get it out there to see what other people think about it.

**Wilderness Expert.** Again, this is based on the UA: CFV’s *Deft Explorer - Canny* ability. Rangers are supposed to be wilderness experts, so with this, you get Expertise in a skill (limited to thematic Ranger skills, don’t worry Rogues and Bards), and you learn a language. At 10th level, you get another Expertise/language as well.

**Favored Foe.** The bane of the Ranger’s existence, this should be the Ranger’s equivalent to the Paladin’s *Divine Smite*. This should be a powerful, class-defining, ability, which is what I’ve tried to do here. It costs a spell slot to activate after you successfully hit a creature (just like *Divine Smite*). Unlike *Divine Smite*, it is sustained damage over time, rather than burst damage all at once.  

I *think* the damage comes out roughly the same if you get a few attacks off on a creature. Right now it is only once per turn, but I may change that to “every time you hit”.

**Fighting Style.** The basic Ranger Fighting Styles are here along with the anticipated ones from *Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything*, a rebalanced Mariner, and my own Versatile Fighting. 

**Spellcasting.** Rangers are the Boy Scouts of D&D and I’ve always felt that should be prepared casters (also Paladins should be Spells Known casters), so I’ve reflected that here. Their spell list isn’t as strong as most, so the ability to prepare spells gives them a slight buff. 

I’ve also given them the option to use a spellcasting focus, and the ability to cast spells as rituals (they have very few ritual spells on their spell list).

**Ranger Archetype.** The Beast Master and Hunter return with some new options/buffs, along with a tweaked version of the UA: Drake Warden, and two of my own homebrew Ranger archetypes; Spellbreaker and Stargazer. The big thing is they now all get archetype spells. 

(*The Ranger Archetypes from Xanathar’s Guide to Everything work as written with the Alternate Ranger).

**Ability Score Improvement, Extra Attack.** No changes here.

**Feral Senses.** This ability actually does something now! (Unlike in the *Player’s Handbook*).

**Foe Slayer.** If you’re the Alternate Ranger’s *Favored Foe* you’d better run. The capstone ability should make you *feel* like the ultimate hunter.

# Ranger Archetypes

**Beast Master.** The Ugly Duckling of 5e - don’t worry I’ve made some changes. You now get the Primal Beasts from the UA: CFV, and I’ve altered the abilities to be more in line with popular homebrew fixes and the Battle Smith Artificer. Less of a pet store owner gone rogue, more of a spirit/hunter duo.

**Drake Warden.** Not much changed from the UA version, just the addition of Archetype Spells and clarified some (seriously) messy wording. ~~If anyone at WotC wants to hire me to proofread their UA I’d be happy to do so~~

**Hunter.** Pretty much the *Player’s Handbook* hunter. I've just added Archetype Spells and a few options at the different tiers. 

**Spellbreaker & Stargazer.** I’ve submitted these guys separately a few times, but if you have suggestions let me know.

**Aeronaut.** Inspired by Rocketman and Leonardo DaVinci, take to the skies with this lofty Artificer Specialty. All of your abilities are based on maneuverability and flight. Strike terror from above!

**Archivist.** A take on my favorite UA that never made it to print. Craft artificial minds inside tiny objects and wreak psychic havoc on your foes!

**Composer.** This one is my favorite, but also the weirdest. Inspired by the weird instruments in Dr. Seuss's books, you can blast foes with thunderous force, and make your allies vibrate with musical power!

**Dungeoneer.** This is the closest thing you’ll get to a “non-magical” artificer, this subclass leans into making the most out of the mundane items in the *Player’s Handbook*. Someone has to be building all these dungeons!

**Forgewright.** Part Kieth Baker’s Forge Adept, part Paladin, this would be my take on an arcane half-caster in the vein of Paladin and Ranger. Weaponize your arcane armament and smite your foes with the power of magic!

# Infusions

I tried to get creative with these, and some may be more powerful than others. Personally, I think the biggest flaw with the official Artificer is that it doesn’t lean *enough* into the *Infusions*. I’d love for them to do almost everything through *Infusions*, but alas they do not. Here are some fun new options!

Just to address some of the raised concerns and common questions - yeah, this is probably a rare item, at first it shielded just you with 3 charges, but then I expanded it slightly and forgot to change rarity.

How to use it - the item prompts casting a spell, so it follows all the rules of casting time, durations and whatnot that are listed on the spell, so for all cases it uses a reaction when the trigger happens.

**The Shaman**

Best known as a bridge between the worlds of mortals and spirits, the shamans can be impressive diviners, healers and curse givers as a supportive pact caster.

**The Variant Class**

The concept of the Variant Class is based on a simple question: what would happen if you replaced a class' gimmick? By getting rid of the warlock's Eldritch Blast and Pact Boons, we have a lot of room to play with a new gimmick or two: in this case, at will cantrip double-casting and one or more omnipresent familiars that can deliver cantrips of any range. Add (very limited) healing and unique subclasses on top and the result is a coherent and different class that feels nothing like the original warlock, despite maintaining pact magic.

I joke, in a way, but I'm also not ruling out making something like that as part of a broader category of weapon and fighting feats. I like people to play the game however they want to play the game as long as it is something that can be plausible supported; even if I personally have some skepticism of it's use outside of showmanship, things in D&D are often drawn from the idea of something being cool to someone that wants to play it, not its practical use (many people tell me that Dual Wielding itself falls in that category).

I will say on the note of Homebrew Katana, personally I'm in the camp that they'd be what I'd consider a longsword refluffed for more curvy-ness; many people seem to want them to be finesse which I am not sure really follows, but if you wanted to go that route no rule of the [Weapon Building Template](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LryJUFU_dWwhVBMfRdb) says that you cannot have a finesse versatile weapon; this would leave it as a 1d6 finesse (1d8 versatile weapon). If you want to maximize how strong it is, you can convert 1d8 to 2d4 for a free .5 bump to make it a 1d6 Finesse (2d4 Versatile weapon); that's even one of the example templates given as many people ask me about it :) While as noted I view it as just a reflavor of longsword personally, I don't think that version breaks anything as long as it stays within the template rules... it's almost always worse than just a 1d8 rapier with dueling and a shield.",UnearthedArcana,Light Weapon Master - Holding two weapons?

Welcome back to another installment of Flashpoint Friday! I enjoyed sharing my [Mythic Encounter: Groenlandica](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/jc9thd/mythic_groenlandica_a_cr_9_mythic_encounter_with/) with everyone last week. You can check out the [gmbinder](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MJXW_K6PBJ_JN2Kfohg) file if you like gargantuan icy caterpillars that turn into equally enormous icy moths!

Typically, this week would be reserved for magic items, but a friend of mine complained earlier this week about the lack of a bludgeoning reach weapon in 5e, and it really got me thinking about quite a few things that are missing. So rather than magic items, this week we have additional weapons.

* [GMBinder: Kibbles' Book of Feats for the Competent Hero on the Go](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LpTGbtupCF1bdXJqvQx). ^Yes ^the ^name ^is ^silly.

This is an odd feat that's been through a few iterations. It was hard to get to where I wanted without stepping on the toes of Martial Adept (or Battlemaster/Sword Bard in general), so this version cuts down on the actual ""tricks"" and more focuses on the mechanics.

This feat encourages the sort of all in all hail mary playstyle - the fact that you cannot stack disadavantage meaning that you will be practically encouraged to double down on whatever ridiculous thing you want to do with your feats of archery.

### Preemptive FAQ (PFAQ?):

> Why does the first bullet point not just say add your Proficiency when that would be simpler and the same thing?

I think the flavor of why you are adding your Proficiency is important. I may drop it if people really don't like the wording, but the idea is that it's your flair for Performance that is making you hit the hard shots.

It says ""up to your Proficiency"" as I have no intention of allowing people with Expertise to add double their proficiency to their attacks, as you could get into something quite silly there.

> Taking Disengage as a bonus action lets you attack as a bonus action.

This is true, and I think this is fine for the power of a feat. It naturally overlaps with the 3rd point meaning that you aren't getting that much more power of the feat.

### Changes:

Updated Version:

##### Trick Shooter v1.05

*Preresquisite: Cannot have the Sharpshooter Feat* 

The feats you can perform with a bow are artistic as they are lethal. You gain proficiency in Performance, and have advantage on archery related Performance checks.

* Your flair for performance allows you to hit improbable shots; once per turn you can add your Proficiency modifier to an ranged weapon attack made with a shortbow or longbow; the harder the attack, the better: if you have disadvantage on the attack roll, you can add your Performance modifier instead.*
* When you use your action to Disengage, you can make a single ranged weapon attack as part of the action.
* When making an ranged weapon attack, you can use your bonus action to make it a trick shot, giving yourself disadvantage but *either* adding another die of damage to the damage roll **or** making the same attack against two targets.

### Explanation of Changes:

> *Note this would still not allow you to add expertise, as it's not an ability check (Expertise allows you to add double your Proficiency modifier to ability checks with that skill, it does not just increase your modifier with that skill). This is nerfed for people that attack multiple times (as it now says once per turn), but buffed for people that attack once (as the benefit has been increased in power). But it also increases the value of a non-disadvantage attack relative to a disadvantage attack, as your Performance will only usually be 2-3 higher than your Proficiency (as it doesn't apply Expertise). Might be slightly too good on niche Hexblade/Sword Bard builds, will take feedback on that.

> The second point now requires you to use your action. The first point is buffed considerably for rogues to make up for this somewhat, and it's still not useless for Rogues (Cunning Action Dash, Disengage With Action, Shoot, not you can do all 3).

> Third point is currently unchanged, though it added ""ranged weapon attack"" restriction.

I have been working over the past few months on a lot of content. Too much, some might say (including myself at times). The reason for this is because I have been working diligently on a massive project: my own setting guide. This setting, known as **Yvarra**, has been the primary setting for my home games for years and I am excited to announce that I am making a complete guide for it. This guide, known as **Yorviing’s Guide to Yvarra** will feature a brand new setting filled with [strange and unusual gods and demigods](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MGQEKDQ9U67Wtw7Ql0A), forgotten and ancient magic, and terrifying creatures that lurk in the dark. This setting book will aim to give both players and GMs alike with a wealth of options to run campaigns and stories within Yvarra, and I hope to release a preview of the project soon!

Today I decided to show off one of the monsters that that will appear YGY. Today’s monster, **The Noonwolf**, is a stronger cousin to their werewolf brethren. While werewolves have connections to the moon, noonwolves (also called aurorwolves or sun wolves), have tied to the sun. They transform when the sun reaches it’s highest peak in the sky, ignore the effects of flame, can spew a breath of fire, and one must fight them with either magic or gilded weapons. 

I hope you are all having a great day, and I hope that everyone enjoys this new monster — **The Noonwolf** :D

Use your CON (in place of DEX) for your monk features, bounce back weapon attacks, resist elemental damage, and eventually create mini-earthquakes around you! Think Sumo Wrestlers, Kung-Fu Panda, or *The Boulder* from ATLA.

***Way of the Feral Warrior.*** Inspired by Kieth Baker’s *Way of the Living Weapon*, I designed this Tradition to be used by races with natural weapons. Minotaurs, Lizardfolk, Tabaxi, etc. Obviously, the DM can lift the restriction if they so choose! Your martial arts die increases by a die size, learn signature moves of bestial, equine, and reptilian creatures, hone your instincts, and become the ultimate predator.

***Way of the Sacred Ink.*** You know what sounds like a fun multiclass? A paladin/monk. Sadly it doesn’t work unless you have straight 18’s in your stats. That’s where the *Way of the Sacred Ink* comes in! You get some fun/thematic proficiencies, a *choice* of three paladin abilities each day, free limited *death ward*, exude the light of heaven, and eventually (briefly) become a celestial yourself.

574,g18tgvz,i8jtxd,"From the Seven Years War to the American Revolution, the colonial battlefields of the 18th century saw significant developments in combined arms fighting. American, British, and French armies deployed line infantry as their primary force—columns of men standing shoulder to shoulder, firing in massed musket volleys—but rangers, skirmishers, and light infantry took on an increasingly important role. 

Though expensive and delicate weapons, long rifles in the hands of colonial sharpshooters proved devastating at range. Dragoons and other light horse regiments typically armed themselves with short-barreled carbines, drawing lances for cavalry charges. Hardscrabble marines in the Royal Navy lobbed axes and primitive grenades during boarding actions. Militiamen, meanwhile, used whatever small arms they had on hand—fowlers, blunderbusses, or other hunting weapons.

These new weapons are designed to be compatible with the 5e firearm rules, particularly the Gunslinger subclass. The flintlocks pack an incredible punch… because if you hit a guy with a .70 caliber musket ball, they're probably not gonna walk it off. As muzzle loaded weapons though, most of them have the Reload 1 trait, meaning they require 1 action or 1 attack to reload after firing.

583,gjtydh8,l0kpau,"Hello everyone! 

I have been working over the past few months on a lot of content. Too much, some might say (including myself at times). The reason for this is because I have been working diligently on a massive project: my own setting guide. This setting, known as **Yvarra**, has been the primary setting for my home games for years and I am excited to announce that I am making a complete guide for it. This guide, known as **Yorviing’s Guide to Yvarra** will feature a brand new setting filled with [strange and unusual gods and demigods](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MGQEKDQ9U67Wtw7Ql0A), forgotten and ancient magic, and terrifying creatures that lurk in the dark. This setting book will aim to give both players and GMs alike with a wealth of options to run campaigns and stories within Yvarra, and I hope to release a preview of the project soon!

Today I decided to show off one of the monsters that that will appear YGY. Today’s monster, **The Yurghal**, is an otherworldly creature created by the Yvarran god of madness, Dayoth. These Lovecraftian/aberration beasties are his personal bodyguard and hunters, recruiting followers and hunting down those who provoke his wrath. 

I hope you are all having a great day, and I hope that everyone enjoys this new monster — **The Yurghal** :D

I noticed that I don't much use Weather in my game. Like with Inspiration, when I interrogated why that was, I just found that it was a rule I sort of bounced off of due to the lack of teeth to dig into the rest of the system. Like with that, I decided to take a stab at an overall that's simple, easy to use, and produces effects that matter and reflect weather patterns without getting too complicated or indepth.

Some of you probably go way more indepth in weather, and that's fine. This is just for people like me that didn't really utilize weather, and gives those people something they can add to their game to bring it to life a little bit more without adding much overhead.

I wanted to keep the weather minor enough that only the most extreme conditions have much impact, but also just annoying enough that it's something in the back of the players minds. I want rain to be a little bit annoying, and bring a little more randomness into overland travel.

### Design Notes

> Why the -2/+2 nonsense? Static modifiers bad!

I considered a few options here, and these are ones I liked the best. First of all, I wanted to give a minor mechanical bite to the effects to they were not entirely just flavor - flavor is great, but flavor backed by some mechanics are excellent.

One of the things I considered was increasing/reducing the size of the dice, but I decided against that for 2 reasons:

* This version is really easy for the DM to apply on their own, the player's don't actually need to remember anything here if the DM wants to run this, and the DM can just describe the how the environment is interacting with the elemental magic.

* That had too big an effect. I actually like that things like *fireball* largely aren't impacted - they are massive bursts of magic the overwhelm mundane conditions, but smaller effects are more impacted by the conditions.

* Elemental Weapon more frequent, and also attached to spending spell slots.
* Each subclass now has an extra spell list.
* The Blade Saint (previously Sword Saint) now gets a cool Sentient weapon!
* Updated a lot of the arts, along with credits to the artists names on them instead of on the final pages.

With this update The Magus is reaching probably one of its final versions, and I'd like to thank everyone who have been contributing to it over the past month and a few days <3 .

For the homebrew, I’m just starting to get familiar with GMbinder so it might look at bit weird in the formatting department. For the monster CR, I hopefully it's appropriate, I myself haven’t tested out these monsters so I can’t determine if they are underpowered or overpowered. I’d love any critique and help when it comes to this. This would be for high level parties.

#GM Binder version [here](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LsYMY6HDj2HiJl7lUNm) - changes will appear here, but not in the posted image.

It's always really annoyed me that the only half blood races available are the half elf and the half orc. At the very least, shouldn't those two races imply the existence of an olf race? And the stout halfling is implied to have dwarvish ancestry, but there's no dwarfling! This homebrew lets you construct a half blooded character of any ancestry.

I've reworked the system a lot for this version. You now get one major trait and one minor trait from each of your parents. In most cases, these racial traits are pre-selected. In a few cases, you can pick your traits from a very small list (such as for half-orcs, who can pick from traits from both the half orc and orc races). Although this provides significantly less customization than previous versions, I think it makes the race overall much better. For one, it makes balancing the various parentage options against each other much easier. By manually curating the traits, I can make sure that no one race becomes a ""must pick"" for all half-bloods (e.g. Mountain Dwarf being a must-pick for most casters thanks to its armor proficiency). For two, it fits better with 5e's design philosophy. 5e has done away with a lot of the granularity and player choice of previous editions in favour of streamlining player progression. This makes character creation and character progression much less daunting for players who aren't as mechanically inclined. In 5e, you no longer have to pick between fourty different classes which range from completely useless to utterly dominant; you just need to pick between twelve, most of which are on par with each other. Similarly, with v3.0 of this race, you no longer need to pick from dozens of possible racial traits, some of which were far more powerful than others; you just snap together two parentages, most of which are roughly on par with each other.

645,g5884db,iskvqa,"**Enhanced Maneuvers**

Homebrewery link: https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/eicT6A8DZ

Hello Unearthed Arcana, I have created two new Maneuvers that I felt were missing among the ones from the Player Hand Book.

**Design**

The following parts are my design notes for the homebrew:

**Discombobulate:** The discombobulate maneuver allows you to remove the reactions of a strong opponent, allowing not only you, but also your teammates to retreat without punishment. It can also be used against enemy spellcasters to prevent them from counterspelling for a round. In addition it sets up your casters to get in a powerful spell. The price is that the save is a constitution save, the save that enemies are best at on average. However, as a battlemaster you can check enemies at level 7 and see if they have a better or worse constitution than you. 

Discombobulate is a situational maneuver designed to work with your team. You won't use it too often, but when you do, it will have high impact if it succeeds.

**Expert Technique:** If you are building a grappling build, then you are often adviced to go rogue/bard for expertise and/or barbarian for the advantage when raging. I found sad that fighter, the class that is supposed to be the master of fighting doesn't have much to add to such a build. With Expert Technique, you can cause a contested roll to go in your favor if you rolled just a bit too little. 

The maneuver is balanced against Precision strike. Precision strike lets you make a missed attack hit, while Expert technique makes a missed grapple or shove succeed. To grapple someone, you often replace one of your attacks with a grapple, so valuing them as equals here doesn't seem out of place. Expert technique also lets you escape grapples and resist shoves, which sometimes might come up and be a nifty benefit.

**Enhanced / Buffed Maneuvers**

**Evasive Footwork:** - This now lets you keep the AC until your next turn if you took one of the mobility/defence actions: Daask, Dodge, or Disengage. Before this maneuver was a very weak disengage that didn't cost any actions to use. That turns out to be rarely useful, so I gave it some more options to be useful.

**Goading Attack:** Now doesn't work with ranged, but now also grants resistance to the damage of the attack, similar the Ancestral Guardian. Being able to use this with ranged seemed a bit cheating and out of flavor, as you could give a melee character disadvantage on all attacks and just run off. You actually still do this with range using menacing attack, so it wasn't even needed for ranged characters, but with that you must at least remain visible. At the same time, there wasn't much point to use this at all on melee characters, since menacing gave disadvantage on all attacks, even against you, and also restricted movement. With the added resistance, you can now really protect your allies at your own expense.

 
**Lunging Attack:** Now works with all attacks you make until the end of your turn. Also the damage can now be on any of the attacks you hit with the turn you use it, so you get the bonus damage even if you miss the first attack. The maneuver is still one of the weaker ones, but now it at least actually functions, as it before became useless as you hit level 5 and it didn't work with extra attack. Now it can be the 5 feet of movement you need to make an attack without dashing, or allow you to strike someone in melee and retreat without being opportunity attacked.

**Parry:** Now works with Strength modifier. This is just a quality of life change. I wanted shield and sword builds in heavy armor to have access to this maneuver.

**Sweeping Attack:** Now deals the superiority die to both the original target and the second target. I would love some feedback on the wording as I am not happy with it. 

Sweeping attack now competes with precision attack and riphoste for ""pure damage"" maneuvers. 

Riphoste - Requires you to be in melee, be attacked, and use your reaction: Gives one extra attack with die - 60 % - 75 % chance of dealing about 15.5  (2d6+1d8+4 (18 str), or 10.85 if we assume 70 % hit rate.

Precision strike - requires you miss an attack, and knows the enemy AC: Gives one guaranteed attack without die - You can choose to use this when you only need to roll a 1 or 2: giving you a 93.75 % chance to succeed: Damage is about 11 (2d6+4 (18 str)) or 10.3 when you account for the chance to miss. This if you only do it on a 1 or 2 needed to hit. If you go for more risky uses, you can use it more often, but the average damage goes down.

Sweeping attack - requires 2 targets and a good attack roll: Gives 2 superiority dices of damage, guaranteed, since you only use it when you know it will hit both: Just 9 damage.

Sweeping attack is still likely a bit worse, since it doesn't get further buffed from fighting styles, magical items or feats, but now it is playable. It also is easy to use and doesn't overkill enemies as much.",UnearthedArcana,Discombobulate your opponent! 2 new brawler manevers for your battlemaster.,Mechanic

### [Kibbles' Compendium of Craft and Creation, Live on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kibblestasty/kibbles-compendium-of-craft-and-creation?ref=9pyscu)

I have a Kickstarter running right now, that will include a future version of **this class**. If you've ever wanted my work in print, here's your chance. The definitive editions of my Alternate Artificer*, Psion*, and Crafting System are all coming to a large compendium - it will be professional edited, loaded with cool custom art, and best of all... it's already funded! Come and check it out.

I know not everyone loves the self-promotion and shilling, but forgive me this time... this is the culmination of over 3 years of things I've shared on this subreddit and some of my most popular content - you folks are a major reason this even exists, and for that I have to sincerely thank everyone that has supported my work with feedback, playtesting, comments, and upvotes. This Kickstarter's launch has exceeded my every expectation.

Sincerely, if you back the Kickstarter or not, thank you - you've been a part of this journey and helped make this content.

To alleviate any potential fears (and sabotage myself on getting backers :D ), the Alternate Artificer and Psion **will remain free online** and continue to get updated. They aren't going anywhere. Likewise, Crafting will remain on my patreon at the $1 tier. The book will have some extra fun stuff (feel free to check out the post), but mostly exists for getting it printed, and to fund making the best version of it yet in the process (something everyone, backers or not, will benefit from). I'm not a very good salesman am I, but there you have it :D

*It should be noted that the published versions will be based on the free versions, but will be written under the OGL not the Fan Content Policy like the free versions.

For those already following the Kickstarter, stay tuned, I'll put an update tomorrow, just waiting to back on a few things :)

Let me know if you have any questions about it, and with that I'll get to your normally scheduled Reddit post...

648,gimtk6v,kszowq,"> But I was wondering if I could ask what your opinion is on the psi subclasses in Tasha's is?

I don't love them, I don't hate them. I think they are okay, but ultimately not that interesting to me; perhaps somewhere between a little to safe and not quite psionic enough. I'm disapointed by a lack of unifying Psionic trait - I did not love the balance or RNG of the psi die (I am fine with RNG, I just think making your resource RNG on top of the effect RNG is very hard to balance and potentially quite frustrating as you've really neutered the player's control of their class at that point... notable this problem vanished at higher levels as the RNG chance to be screwed got vanishingly small, but that lead to its own problem), but I would have liked to see an effort to build a unified psionic system, as not it just gets awkward for them if they do in the future and those don't use it.

I think the Psi Knight is perfectly serviceable, I just don't feel it does anything that only a Psionic character could do I guess. It works, it's moderately balanced.

The Soul Knife Rogue I am less fond of, but more biased on, as I prefer Soul Knife as either a Monk or a standalone thing (and [have my own](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LlNuBWzsP3xuHfyaf6A) as a monk subclass). I think it fails to capture what I'd expect from a Soul Blade, and it has some really awkward mechanics around the actual making of the knife. All that baggage aside, it's a class someone could play and have fun with if they didn't have the same hang ups as me (though the Soul Knife not working for opportunity attacks is one of those things that would get old fast).

I think ultimately the biggest problem I have with them and their approach to Psionics in general is that they put the cart before the horse - designing Psion spin offs before the Psion is sort of backwards, because the Psion should define how Psionics work - or at least what they can do and how they feel... that's also the point where I decided they were probably not going to offer a Psion and went all in making mine.

Obviously I think WotC are very smart people and good designers that know what they are doing; I don't think they failed to design psionics or anything like, I think they just have different data on what people want - probably more accurate to the overall user base, but my following (and the folks here on reddit) are not the overall user base and can generally handle something a little more crunchy with more mechanical weight to its theme. My personal suspicion is that the general wider D&D audience would also like that if introduced to it in a reasonable way (UA Mystic had a lot of unresolved problems that were never really iterated on) but of course I'd think I'm right... that's human nature :D

I have bigger problems with Tasha's that makes me doubt the above paragraph a little (Twilight Domain Cleric... Peace Domain Cleric...) but the Psionic subclasses I'd just rate somewhat disappointing and little clunky (though I think the Psi Knight is fully serviceable; if a little on the uninspired side to me).",UnearthedArcana,Kibbles' Psion v1.4 - Read minds and break them!

Hey, r/UnearthedArcana! Another Saturday, another brew, and this week's is something special. The Paragon was one of the first pieces I ever published to Unearthed Arcana, and it's had a very positive reception from the players who've used it for their characters. I wanted to update it and raise it to my current standard, so here's the Paragon v3!

The Paragon is a highly customizable martial class, encouraging you to define exactly who your paragon character is with a wide choice of flairs and other abilities to use. Your paragon's sheer nerve is motivated by devotion to a certain cause that eternally drives them forwards, pushing them to improve and master their abilities.

You can find the previously posted [Blacksmithing](https://www.reddit.com/r/KibblesTasty/comments/k4i37o/kibbles_crafting_blacksmithing_forge_armor/) and [Alchemy](https://www.reddit.com/r/KibblesTasty/comments/kbe3uf/kibbles_crafting_alchemy_brew_the_strongest/), or you can find the whole guide with everything in its most up-to-date version [on my patreon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/crafting-0-3-2-45172232) (at the $1 tier)

Some of the Standard Disclaimers:

* While this ready to be used and being used by many people, it also a pre-1.0 version. There will be errors and mistakes. A lot of work is going into this system, and it has a lot of moving parts. 

* This does not list every magic item. Some of them fall into their own branches (Wands) some of them are just more tables that aren't complete yet, this is a large sampling of the ones I could include, and far more will be added in time (both custom and some of the other SRD ones I've missed).

* This system has many branches; I've previously posted Blacksmithing Alchemy, this is Enchanting. Wands have their own section (Wand Whittling! Using Wood Working tools); I've decided to include Scroll Scribing here, as it's a very helpful section to the enchanting section.

* Personally I don't use the pricing listed. These prices have been adapted to be compatible with games running more standard PHB/DMG gold values than I use, and from the feedback so far are a reasonable adaption, but personally I use a much more compressed system.

* This has some instances where I've used my own version of something marked via ^K^; you can feel free to replace this with the default version if you'd like, the balance assumptions would be the same. 


I'll post the PDF of this system as I don't want to make legibility a patreon exclusive, but the PDF I'm posting here, will probably not update as more stuff is added the system.

The following is an introduction to my crafting system, which is the same as with the other crafting posts (mostly):

____ 

## Why do you need Crafting?
Some people may wonder - why do you need a crafting system? Isn't that what loot is for? The truth is, in some games, that's true. Not every adventurer is going to want to pursue crafting. But with a crafting system, not only can you craft what you need without finding it in a dragon hoard, what you find in that dragon hoard can be so much more.

In a game with a robust crafting system, there is no junk, there is just more opportunities and fresh possibilities. A +1 shortsword that no one can use could be the valuable basis of a new spear. Gems, gold, relics, and recyclables... all valid entry points for the crafters creativity. 

Adventurers are inherently innovative folks on a quest for creative solutions to difficult problems. Crafting gives them that toolbox.

So... why do you need crafting? You don't. But you should probably want it.

### Who can craft?
Anyone! Who can succeed in making something useful? Perhaps a bit of a different story. Crafting is not inherently tied to class, though in some cases some classes may give benefits to it (like Artificer); crafting may come from your background in the form of a tool proficiency, or it may be something you learn during your adventures following the old adage of necessity being the mother of invention.

Crafting is mostly about the time, effort, knowledge and materials. As such, most of crafting is knowing the recipe and having the time and materials needed... but a skilled craftsman works quicker and is more successful, and in this business practice makes perfect, so there are various progression modifiers that apply. Your DM can determine if your background would merit starting your adventure with any, otherwise guidelines for how to gain them are included.

### What can I craft?
Anything! But this guide is made by a mere mortal, and is thus limited in scope. This guide will provide the principles of crafting for many fields - from alchemy to engineering to woodworking. 

The basis of how crafting works is similar between each field, but the recipes, material, and most important results will be radically different... After all, a healing potion, a catapult, and a magic sword are all things you can craft, but the process for each varies quite a bit.

The goal of this document is teach you how to get started, and provide the basics that will get you a long way into your adventure, but not make a complete codex of everything that could potentially be crafted. When you hit something that doesn't appear in this document, just reference the closest items and make a bit of a leap to what extra steps might be needed to realize your vision into your D&D world!

### A Player Driven System
One of the fundamental goals and inspirations of the crafting system is to make it a player driven system. It is a system where the player can say ""**I** would like to harvest the monster for ingredients"" and ""**I** would like to forage as we go through the forest looking for alchemy reagents"" and ultimately ""**I** would like to make a healing potion"" and all those rules can be exposed in a PHB like style to the player. The DM still adjudicates many instances of them, but the ideal is to have a system in which the DM does not have to handcraft every instance of gathering materials and crafting.

### Hooking Your Players In
On the other hand, if the DM wants to get the players into it, there are some tools they can use. By far the most effective tool is to give the players reagents as part of loot that don't have an obvious place to sell them. If you give players 2 curative reagents, they are going to start looking into how they can use those, as they'd much rather have a healing potion.

If you want to go one further though, if you give them *5* curative reagents and they realize they will have a remainder of one... then they start looking into ""Well, how do we get a 6th!""

### Depth and Complexity
This system has two goals: to be simple and easy to use, and to be deep and extensible. Naturally these are somewhat at odds, and accomplished by having a great deal of optional depth. To produce standard items with standard effects, the process for finding or buying the materials and using them to make what you want to make will be straightforward. However, it always allows a degree of customization and specificity for those that look further. Whipping up a potion of healing is fairly easy, but you can also delve into the custom potions and brew something entirely unique.

How much of the detail you want to engage with as a DM can be easily adjusted by how you hand out reagents. By sticking to the standard ingredients and using their generic names, the materials are no more complicated than handing out gold or other rewards (and can even be fully converted easily to a gold based system if you want the most simplified version), but if you'd like to have specific ingredient names and exotic ingredients with special effects, those are there for you to pull from.

##### Generic Ingredients
Above and throughout the document, you will see that ingredients are referred to by generic tags like ""common curative reagent"" rather than specific natures. For example, you may harvest magical herbs, and find Kingsbane in the forest, a poisonous plant. For the purposes of crafting, this can be recorded simply as a ""common poisonous reagent"" and used as such in crafting. 

This greatly simplifies the process of crafting and recording what your supplies are. Narratively speaking, a skilled alchemist can render down the ingredients they want to use in the form they need.

Each crafting profession will have some profession wide materials that are used in their recipes - reagents for alchemy, metals for blacksmithing, etc. 

Some very rare and legendary items will have specific ingredients; this is for flavor rather than balance, though is up to your DM.

##### Camp Actions

A recommended complimentary system is the Kibbles Camp Actions which can be found [**here**](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MK0g94rlPq9A0KprEKC) and provide more formalized rules for how to make use of your time during a long rest.

Welp, that's a  long post at this point. Hopefully it answers any and all questions, but if it doesn't, feel free to ask. As always, I welcome any feedback and thoughts on the system. Its a system I currently use and a system that's being tested by many folks, but I welcome any thoughts and feedback, as well as thoughts on things you'd like to see in the system in the future.

As always, I have [a website](https://www.kthomebrew.com/) if you want to find more of my stuff, and [a patreon](https://www.patreon.com/KibblesTasty) if you want to support the endeavor of making things like this. I also have [a Discord](https://discord.gg/msWF9EP) where you are free to drop by and see the latest, share your thoughts, or ask me any questions.

659,gn8ixt5,lj3fd3,"Hey everyone! I'm happy to present a new class; my pet project. The Trainer.

As the title suggests, its a class for those who wish to fight side by side a their best friend, their companion. Its inspiration origination does come from the beast master subclass. However, I never did like it, as I thought there could be so much more to a character who has a companion than 'just' a ranger. Beast masters appear in various forms throughout pop culture, and I wanted to capture part of that essence.

Namely, the companion should take on a greater role during character development and advancement. I offer that by unlocking new companion traits depending on what type of companion the player wants. Also, if the play doesn't like what I presented in terms of options, they should work with their DM to create an appropriate stat block representative of that genus/family. For example, a lizard friend may be semi-aquatic, but I did not present an amphibious companion.

I've done a semi-serious update since the first posting.  Thanks to Reddit, friend, and player feedback, the class/subclass levels 1-3 features have been adjusted and updated.  Players now choose their Way of Life  starting at level 1, and gain an additional feature at level 3.  Moreover, the subclass balance has been updated, and 2 new subclasses added; The Gravetender and (by popular demand) Swarmkeeper.  Most importantly though, the command point and companion action systems has been rewritten to maximize clarity.  Lastly, I have done a thorough editing review to correct any grammatical errors.

## Power Word Charm

*8th-level enchantment*

* **Casting Time:** 1 action
* **Range:** 60 feet
* **Components:** V
* **Duration:** Instantaneous
* **Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You speak a word of power that can bewitch a creature that you can see within range. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it becomes *charmed* by you. While charmed in this way, the target regards you as their closest friend and most trusted ally.

The target may make a Wisdom saving throw once every hour and whenever you deal damage to it. On a success, the charm effect ends.

1. It *is* enchantment magic. You are messing with the target's mind, so it makes sense for the target to act irrationally.

2. There is some existing discussion in other comment threads concerning this homebrew versus *dominate monster*. I'll redirect you to those remarks.

**Nerfed Powder Bag and its hide action:** Only get five uses of the bag per short rest, and only gives you advantage on the stealth roll for hide action.

 **Deadly Distraction now doubles damage after all modifiers are applied and cannot be used against the same creature again within seven days.**

I've played with people who are a living incarnation of this subclass. They are some of the most obnoxious people I've ever met, but playing D&D with them was an experience I will never forget. So to this end, I made a class that glorifies the idea of distraction, and put a theatrical theme to it.

668,gakxr3z,jksq1b,"So, one of the things I get asked a lot is... ""say Kibbles, when you are going to make a Revised Rangers... all Homebrewers do it eventually!"" and I sort of already have in the form of the Beast Master, but have been relatively content with the UA Variant Feature Ranger to the point I didn't really think it needed it? It wasn't perfect, but as I generally said... the problem is with their spell list more than anything. And here's my fix to that.

Let's step back for a minute... Would Paladin be a good class without Divine Smite, or any of their Smite spells? I think... not really? It'd be on the low side of mediocre, really. A somewhat martial Cleric thing? So why do people expect Rangers to be good without using their spell slots?

Ranger has this weird thing where people just tend to straight up ignore that it's half caster - I think the rise of people talking about a Spell-less Ranger is because people see the Ranger spell casting as... extraneous. Vestigial. Outside of Hunter's Mark... just not really *part of their damage*. You use it for like... *goodberry* and maybe the occasional *healing spirit*.

Well... that's crazy. That's, to me, obviously the problem. A ranger isn't a Fighter with a bow... that's a Fighter with a bow. A ranger is a Fighter-with-a-bow-or-sometimes-a-sword-that-also-knows-god-damned-magic. So let's put that magic to good use, and I think pretty much anyone will have a much better time with a Ranger. Their core may still not be perfect. You may still not agree with the changes from UA->TCoE. But with a solid spell list to give it some unique tricks... I think they'll be distinctly more satisfying to play.

It should be noted these are not *free* power. A Rangers utility spells are quite good, really. *Goodberry* and particularly *pass without a trace* can be extremely good spells. And if you use these, you will be spending the resources that are often taken for granted in using those utility spells.

#### Original Steel Wind Strike

If we are being honest, this is one of the rare spells I don't love as written. I dislike it because it has something it is clearly trying to do, and then it doesn't do that. It is a mechanically good spell. For Wizards. But why? Even for a Bladesinger, this spell just doesn't really make sense, for the key reason that it *uses the wrong stat*. It makes a melee **spell** attack not a melee **weapon** attack, meaning that it uses your spell casting modifier. This makes it a decidedly mediocre spell for who I feel was it's intended audience... after all, it's *ranger* capstone spell, ain't it?

So, I'll chalk this weird discrepancy up to the Wizards in charge of copying it down and recording it corrupting it to make it a better Wizard spell while ignoring it's original purpose. This version, than, rather than being a modified version, I reckon is the true original version.

Even if we are going to allow Wizards to keep casting this spell, it should cater to the kind of Wizard that is actually using a weapon to hit things, not be a weapon-flavored-force-damage-storm.

I also changed the school, because *we aren't conjuring a sword-flavored force storm* any more and we are rapidly *teleporting around* with would be Conjuration (like all other teleportation spells). There's an argument to be made for Transmutation too (either like *haste* but much faster or literally transmuting into the wind) but I prefer the teleportation interpretation to avoid confusion around how it would interact with terrain and creatures in the way and things). Again, wanted to keep the simplicity of the spell.

#### Iron Wind Strike

The other problem with Steel Wind Strike is that 5th level spells just aren't something Ranger's get to cast a lot. Games rarely go that long, and leaving them out to dry for 16 levels is what they refer these days as ""a dick move"". So, Iron Wind Strike, a 2nd level version. Smaller in redius. Less targets. Less damage. But comes on line at level 5.

So let's tackle some of the points of contention here:

> 3d8 x 3 is a lot of damage! 

This is originally higher than I was thinking, but I decided to match Shatter. Shatter has some serious pros (60 foot range, potential for more targets) and some down sides (Con Save, friendly fire). Ultimately I decided these were equally weighed in pros and cons.

> But it also teleports! It's better than Misty Step!

It is quite a bit different. It deposits you next to a target creature... but *after* you have just spent your action. Generally speaking, you don't really want to be next to the monster super bad after you don't have an action. That it teleports you isn't a *bad* thing and certainly has uses, but it's just very different than *misty step*, and if you want to hit one creature, *misty step* -> attack will certainly be more damage, and goes a good bit further.

#### Multishot

Before we forget... Rangers *do* frequently use bows. For the most part, the spells they get to enhance their ability to use them is pretty rough. *Hunter's mark* is good of course, but it is what it is, and not what we are currently looking for here. This is another really simple one that is something magic-people-with-bows can pretty much always do, so... let's just make this a spell, give it to Rangers, and be done with it.

To explain the line: ""This damage roll does not add any modifiers or bonus associated to weapon attacks."", this line is essentially saying ""pls fuck off Sharpshooter, don't rain on my parade"". Sharpshooter is a great feat and all, but would obviously be busted if allowed to apply in this case.

The damage of 2d8 is a sort of middle ground, that is largely as low as it is due to how it scales and that it is only a bonus action to cast. On one hand, that's very high for a bonus action, but if we introduce the elephant in the room, Divine Smite is a hit-confirmed 2d8 focused damage for no action at all.

The scaling part of it is, in a way, too good. But I think it's mostly fine - if you cast this as a 5th level spell, you're dealing 10d8 total. If you cast Steel Wind Strike you're dealing 30d10. I.e.... no, not really really worried about upscaling there (and if we want to compare to something like Scorching Ray, 6d6 > 4d8, so we aren't really breaking any particular level of damage), and again... Ranger only spell means those high level spell slots are precious. It probably is better *conjure barrage*, but I'm just not really losing a lot of sleep over that if I'm being honest.

#### Alacrity

This is one that stole... from myself. This is a Spell from [my Occultist](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-M-WtrKeZNFdEXq0MKXw), that, once again, is a really simple thing. It's *haste*. But 1 turn of *haste*. It's a very powerful spell though, as it doesn't have some of the main drawbacks of *haste* - namely lack of Concentration and the much more minor spell-end effect (though, as a 1 round spell, that's by necessity). I find it's a really good spell for gish's though. It provides a tool of benefits that are super useful, but costs enough that it generally isn't the optimal way to do damage with spell slots. The drawback to it is actually relatively new, as I found it somewhat too good when chaining it at higher levels where you start to have too many spell slots.

If this was a Ranger only spell, I'd call it something like... Feral Surge... or Wild Burst... but I decided to keep this the template spell I use elsewhere.

##### Windsense.

Before someone tells me giving blindsight of 60 feet is illegal, I'd like to point out WotC's new Fighting Style gives a 10 foot blind sight permanently. Not quite comparable, but it does show there's nothing ""sacred"" about it existing at low levels (perhaps I'm a touch defensive of that one from arguments around the Psion :D ). Still, it's basically a radar + trick shot for a 2nd level spell. Super useful, but not really going to be tapping out the damage meters, but makes Rangers the masters of ranged attacks they were always meant to be - hiding from their arrows *should* be futile. They *should* be the terrifying predator that can prowl the wind the itself to find you.

##### A Bonus... Shadowblade

Just grab it and add it the Ranger list. Why not. It'll be fun. It's at least someone that can actually *use it*.

...okay, a little rant... Shadowblade is a cool spell that *almost no one can use*. Warlocks - the prime candidate - cannot use it because it doesn't play nice with Pact of the Blade and consequently doesn't work with any of their Extra Attack. Wizards, for the most part, have little interest in making weapon attacks, and have better things to do with concentration most of the time if they (*haste*). EKs are pretty much the only good users of it, and they get it effectively by accident. AT's can use it decently, but it loses a lot of value without Extra Attack.

So... give it Rangers. They'll do some cool stuff with it. It'll be fun.

While I think I'm going to be delaying [my Kickstarter](https://www.kthomebrew.com/notify-me) a bit to let people have some time with TCoE, I'm going to compile all of my spells into Kibbles' Casting Compendium shortly, and I'll throw that up on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/KibblesTasty) early next month. I don't tend to have much patreon-only things, but as a thanks to all that support there, I'm going to try to provide some collections and compendiums there, and I think a collection of all the various spells I've made over the years will be the first one - collected, curated, edited and revised. If it sounds like something interesting, I'd expect it the first week of November there - this is all possible due to the support of folks there who have supported for all this time despite me releasing every for free, so this will be the first of many efforts to give 'em back a little a something.",UnearthedArcana,"Ranger Spells That Don't Suck by KibblesTasty - An alternative approach to ""fixing"" Ranger and giving it some notable spells.",Spell

Today I present to you all a project that has been a year in the making: ‘Yorviing’s Arcane Grimoire’! (Version 1.0)

**Before we get started, a quick heads up:** 

This is the major **non-art version** of the project. I am posting this for 2major reasons: 

I had some family medical issues come up with my wife, and then I have a grandmother in severe critical condition, and between all of that and starting up grad school again and switching jobs, I haven’t had the full dedicated time to do the art as well as all of the other things for YAG. Hence, the only art you will find is the cover and final page, which is an acrylic painting that was made by me! I will mention that I **do plan on making all of the art for this project myself.** However, I just need to have more time to do so. 
I know I had to have missed some issues with YAG, what with grammar, spelling, balance, etc. So while I tried my absolute best, some things definitely slipped through the cracks. So, might as well get some of that out of the way before I add in all of the art that I want to make for it!

In this project, which you can find here: [Yorviing’s Arcane Grimoire](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AwqXAd2qxB13mq-c5xVD82WFHgHS5reM/view?usp=drivesdk), you will find a 140 page compendium of content based primarily on wizards and arcane themes, which includes the following: 

**30 Arcane Traditions for the Wizard**

**5 non-wizard subclasses**

**10 additional backgrounds**

**14 major roll tables for backstory and flavor**

**A ninth school of magic called “Quantumurgy’**

**Over 200+ spells**

**20+ magic items**

**6 feats**

**10 new stat blocks for animals to be used as familiars**

**Two setting neutral factions**

I have been working all of 2019 on this project, and I am hoping that by the end of 2020 I will not only have this project completely finished, edited, and revised, but potentially even published as a physical book (here’s to hoping, yea?). 

I will be updating this project throughout the remainder of 2020, and every time that I do so, I will not only be revising and editing the existing content, but adding and creating even more content to go along with it (I actually have 73 wizards, but cut down to less than half for this, YAG Version 1.0)

I want to take a brief moment to say that I absolutely could not have done this without the help of my wife, my nephew, and all of the friends that I have made via Discord and the r/UA subreddit. I owe it all to y’all, and this project is dedicated to everyone that helped me, believed in me, and encouraged me throughout the entirety of last year. 

If you do end up using any of the content, feel free to let me know via Reddit! I would love to hear constructive feedback and what you like about the content! And again, don’t worry about the blank spaces, as I will be getting to the custom art as soon as I can!

**Final Notes:**

**Art:** The few pieces of art that are presented in YAG are done **by me** as acrylic paintings uploaded as the cover pieces. 

**Brew Schedule:** Beginning next week, I will begin posting one post a week on Thursday’s, which I will dub as ‘Yorvsday Brews’. Keep a look out for soon to be weekly content!

**Thanks:** Seriously, yall are awesome and incredible, and I can’t wait to make even more content for all of you! 

**Patreon:** If you like any of the work that I do, and wish to support me further, feel free to check out my Patreon at [Yorviing](https://www.patreon.com/Yorviing)

This the 2.0 update for Alternate Artificer! In the end, this is probably not as big a change as some of the items that were considered, and more of an expansion and spring cleaning. The exercise here was to pick up pretty much everything and evaluate if it made sense in this being a standalone class. The high level summary of the changes are as follows:

* Soul of Aritifce is replaced with Peerless Inventor. Soul of Artifice was a powerful capstone, but wasn't that evocative or interesting, it didn't change how you play the character, and just made a good thing better (which is fine, just not as interesting).
* Cannonsmith has been renamed Thundersmith as, while it still does Cannons, it also does alternate weapons now.
* Wandsmith is folded into Infusionsmith; I feel this improves both classes. Wandsmith was by far the least popular subclass, but had some dedicated supporters, while it was always awkward that Infusionsmith had wands basically excluded from their upgrades due to Wandsmith's existence.
* Warsmith gained Artificial Strength to allow non-strength characters to rely on the Strength of their armor... at a cost.

Frequently Asked Questions/General Info:

> Why does this exist now that the new UA Artificer is different?

This was originally an update to the old UA Artificer, and when the new UA Artificer went a different direction, it has split off to become it's own thing as that's what people wanted. While I don't hate the new UA Artificer, it's a different beast holding down a different design space, and doesn't quite line up with what Artificers are in the eyes of many players. I left it up to the community if this should be merged or continue on it's own way, and the overwhelming ask was to keep it a seperate thing.

> Why is this nearly 40 pages? Is that necessary? Wasn't the 2.0 supposed to be streamlined?

In a way, you could consider this almost like a bundle of 7 classes sharing a similar structure, rather than 1 class that is very detailed. A Warsmith vs. a Gadgetsmith vs. a Potionsmith vs. a Fleshsmith will be very different characters, they just share a class chassis due to how 5e class design works (making a class with just 1 subclass doesn't really fit it's model), but the subclasses themselves are designed broadly enough to capture several playstyles.

While 5e is a bit light on character customization at the class level, I feel the Artificer is the place to break this mold a bit, as it gives mechanical weight to feeling like you are making the things that make your character powerful.

While I considered changing this in the 2.0, people preferred the way it is, even if that way isn't for everyone, it provides thousands of people with characters they want to play, and I decided that was more important to preserve - there is always the UA Artificer for people that feel there is just no way to integrate a 20+ page plus class.

What I can say is while the process of making the character is a bit unique due to the customization involved, the result is balanced for 5e in actual play, and won't perform significantly different than a PHB character in terms of power and options in combat; the fact the subclasses have their own upgrade prevents the sort of cross build power synergy seen with things like the UA Mystic, even if it adds considerably to the class length.

> Is this balanced?

This is a large update to a complicated class, so I would always recommend if you are allowing something like this with a lot of moving parts, you keep your eyes open and make what changes you need. That said, the previous version is played by thousands of players (actually thousands, it's crazy), and has gotten feedback from hundreds of them, and that feedback has worked it into a state that I can be fairly confident in saying it will not break your game, and in the vast majority of cases will slot in well within 5e expectations.

> Is there... even more??

The Expanded Toolbox will be updated in the coming weeks for 2.0 version, but is currently not updated (as much of it has been moved here). Once the Expanded Toolbox comes, the Runesmith will return for the next iteration, a bunch of new upgrades, spells, etc... and eventually a new subclass to replace the Fleshsmith in the Expanded Toolbox.

For those that didn't see it, there was a cool Homebrew subclass made called the [Limbsmith](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-Lchle5AJIjX0yZB59Yv) by /u/MrKybernetes; Taking the self-forged to a new level, this is option is for those that strive for perfection... in their own eyes. Which might not be their own eyes anymore, as those might have been replaced with a better set.

683,etk74aq,cal77v,"Mindsmith was retired, as it was never really finished. It still exists, and can be found [**here**](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LXm0faZRDOJObmuqdMj) but isn't really polished, and hasn't been updated for the last few versions, but is probably fairly usable.

The Expanded Toolbox is currently under going reconstruction as most of it's content was pilleaged for 2.0 (it's essentially my playtest material, and most of it's material was playtested and moved here). You can find it in its current form [**here**](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LR85y6FKnWhRAWIJgSP). In about 2 weeks it will be updated with new stuff, and sometime next month it will probably get a new subclass to replace Fleshsmith not that Fleshsmith is in the main document, but that's not the top of the priority chain yet.

Regarding magic items, I don't like the ""free magic item"" crafting. It doesn't gel with how I run the game, and seems like cop out to crafting in general. As I frequently say, my Artificer is not, nor is it intended to be, a solution to crafting. In my view, an Artificer is typically better at crafting, but anyone should be able to craft magic items if that is a core part of your game and they have the proficiency for it. If I give the Artificer a crafting system, it implies that no one else can craft things. The reason that Artificer crafting is so vague is that it is meant to plug into what the DM uses for crafting, not replace it like the WotC system does.

I also disagree with taking that sort of decision out of the DM hands - some DMs may value giving the party a Bag of Holding as not something that should be free at level 2. A bag of hold is basically a default part of the game in some campaigns, but would be a pretty major campaign changing thing in others - there is no such thing as a survival element challenge with a bag of holding in the party. In general, I wouldn't allow the ""open the DMG and pick your item"" style crafting, so I don't write it into my classes; I don't think players should need the DMG, and I think it causes a lot of problems - it's what caused the 3.5 Artificer so many problems.

Lastly, it's just a lot of power taken from the class and spent on things that you can give away; I tend to not like being able to give away class power, as it leads to problematic party optimization, as well as an optimal strategy being having less fun so someone else can have more fun; the Artificer should be using their own items as much as possible, because other classes already have their own cool toys/features from their own features - stacking onto those gets you into trouble with balance, and makes the Artificer boring to play (not everyone will agree with me there, but that's my take). I prefer making item crafting to exist outside of class balance so that magic items can be applied to the party - either through loot or crafting, in a more sane manner.

I will, eventually, publish my crafting system which will somewhat tie into the Artificer, but that's probably a long way out. My crafting system is very resource based and ad-hoc, so is hard to translate to published form.

684,ewovrvh,cal77v,">  is that you balanced the Golemsmith arround UA ranger which is quite op imho.

I quite specifically did not do this; I do not use the UA Ranger (I use [my own Beastmaster Ranger](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LW4mwkl1RfhNcctC73_), for reference), and it has been discontinued by WotC; I don't typically consider it; I was using it as a comparison as you brought it up here. I didn't balance Golemsmith around ranger at all, in a specific sense. I balanced it against the other Artificer subclasses and against a handful of template builds from the PHB I test everything against (Fighter, Rogue, full caster); as far as I consider it, there are no official functional pet classes in the game right now, but it you compare it to PHB Ranger (considered very bad) it is stronger, and if you compare it to UA Ranger or UA Artificer, it is much weaker (UA Artificer pets, as noted, have essentially unlimited daily health, which shows WotC's position on this... keep in mind to most people, I'm the bad person saying your pet health cannot be unlimited, very few people have ever told me they felt it was *too high*).

> But at level 5 you are not adding the Int mod to Golemsmith Firebolt, 

How would they get +Int on Firebolt at level 5? The only easy way they can do that is CDK (Cross Disciplinary Knowledge) which they don't get until level 6; I was being charitable to give them Firebolt at level 5 at all (using magic initiate or high elf) to make the comparison closer - in truth, they are further behind that at 5, not closer. I did add it at 11, because by the Golemsmith has CDK which can provide Blasting Rod, and that's typically their best option.

> you are adding the favoured enemy damage (which wont be applying consistently) and you are adding an attack to a pet that (as you correctly clarify) it cost a reaction to do, 

It costs the pet's reaction though, which does not lose you much, as you are going to spending that reaction to either make an attack of opportunity (rarely), or attack. So it basically just forces getting the attack of opportunity on your turn - but attacks of opportunity is fairly rare; if they weren't, rogues would have be considered very powerful.

> you are also not adding the d6 for the hunter's mark to the ranger which is more consistent than favoured enemy. At level 11 you are not counting the haste of the golem but you are counting the Clawstorm as one attack and again adding the full favoured enemy damage. For me, the math would be:

Favored Enemy humanoid was extremely reliable in my experience (and in my opinion, what actually makes the UA Ranger broken in general). Hunter's Mark is a resource, and I was comparing nonresource based damage. I also included the fact that even without counting Favored Enemy, UA Ranger dealt more. Haste is a far more limited resource than anything else here, and complicates the math a lot as now I'd have to do 3-5 round comparison rather than a 1 round comparison as they lose attacks the turn they activate haste, meaning that they don't gain any benefit (damagewise) until 3+ rounds... and they can do that once per day. If I was comparing the burst damage between Rangers and Golemsmiths, Golemsmiths actually fall quite a bit further behind as they don't have many offensive spells.

> They are not as far as you noted. And, I must insist, me and most of the community consider the UA Ranger pretty op.

That's why I included a base-line optimized build (PHB Fighter... without even including a subclass, does more damage than Golemsmith too). Comparing it to the UA Ranger wasn't my idea in the first place, not a typical benchmark I use, though I can understand why people would make that comparison as it is the most widely used pet class currently in the game (even if, in my opinion, it has been depreciated and should not be used anymore, far more people play UA Ranger than PHB Ranger for beast master, as PHB ranger is mostly unplayable).

> As I said, my problem with the Golemsmith is not the damage or the utility that it provides, is the HP and how easy can get stat increases when it has a fairly strong base stats (specially the Quadrupedal). After I saw your post, we adjusted the hit points to 4+Con per level and changed the stat boost upgrades to only give +1 instead of +2. We played two sessions this weekend with 6 battle encounters, trying 3 golem configurations (Warforged, Quadrupedal and Specialized) and the Specialized is probably the worst because the nerf to stats upgrades hit him more than the others because of its special trait, so we add to it: ""For Specialized golem the first time you get the upgrades Fine Tuned Dexterity, Systematic Strenght and Structural Constitution, you increase the ability score by 2 instead of by 1"" and with that you can do some interesting builds.

This is fine if works for you, but the thing I would worry about here is this: If the golem dies, the Golemsmith is extremely weak until it is recovered. If it is significantly easier to kill than a player, than you are making a subclass that can be easily knocked out of the whole adventuring day when they pet dies, so the pet should not be signficantly easier to kill than a player; that's why it's balanced the way it is - where it does not provide more *daily resources* by not recovering a ton of health, but is also not going to be trivial to knock out and make the Golemsmith useless the rest of the day - it forces them to spend resources keeping it functional, but does just make them a spectator because it died. The Golem should not die significantly more than a player, because that has roughly the same effect on that player's adventuring day as dying - they lose almost all their combat power for the day.

I feel that trying to enforce higher risk on the Golem just makes the ranged option better, which is something I've been trying to limit, as the ranged option is already generally better.

You may or may not be aware; older versions had the +1 stat per upgrade, but people sort of hated that, as it basically meant you couldn't get any more interesting upgrades, as an optimal build will always have to max the stats. So I made the stat growth quicker/cheaper, but capped the stats at 18, so that the golem never overshadows players.

I also think that making a Large creature have low hit points is generally a mistake. Large creatures naturally take quite a bit more damage - they rarely can benefit from cover, they are included in more AoEs, frequently have disadvantage from squeezing, and they have more adjacent squares to be attacked from; in exchange, they have more zone control - but zone control is meaningless if you don't want to be hit, so making it a squishy target compared to the PCs makes making it large purely a negative trait; this is why the Quadrupedal Golem has the con bonus in the first place.

> Of course i dont think you are mistaken or confused, we have different opinions in how to balance a class, I think that Golem has too much durability (Specially the Quadrupedal) and you think that durability is compensated for the lack of Hit Dice recovery and for having less dmg output than UA Ranger (which I think is wrong). Just for the record, I also think that have a powerspike at lvl 5 and the class could be underwhelming from levels 1-5, but we are not playing on that levels.

As noted; it's damage isn't really balanced against the UA Ranger. There are plenty of PHB builds that easily out damage the Golemsmith, including Fighters.

Again, I am not criticizing what works for your game, I'm not there, and maybe in your game it is too good; every game will have a unique blend of player optimization and how the DM runs their encounters - if you don't use a lot of ranged attacks or enemy AoE, maybe being large is more of a benefit.",UnearthedArcana,"Kibbles' Alternate Artificer v2.0 - Forge armor, wield cannons, enchant swords, infuse potions, and so much more better than ever!

All of this will be added to my final project, with the idea being that these base Dragonborn are in Toril and have been granted blessings because they are no longer on the god less world of Albeir. 

That is also why I will be adding this variant: 

Variant Dragonborn: God Forsaken: “You are a Dragonborn from Abeir, a world without gods, or you have forsworn all dragon gods. If you choose this variation you do not gain a subrace, as you are not blessed by any dragon god. In exchange you gain the Draconic Heritage feat at 1st level, for which you must choose the Wings trait of the Wayfarer subrace, and you can’t choose this feat again. Additionally, if you choose this variant, you can use your breath weapon as a bonus action. When you do so, you don't add your proficiency bonus to the damage roll.“",UnearthedArcana,"Dragonborn (Revised), finalized after feedback",Race

I had to make sure this synergized with the sword from my last post, so I couldn't give the absorption ability a reaction cost. It is pretty strong, but on the other hand, it's only usable once per long rest, and I don't think it's fun to have to save your reaction *just in case* the enemy wizard has *lightning bolt* prepared.

______________________________

Sword Mages were my favorite class in 4e. It has been attempted a few times in 5e, with Eldritch Knights and Stone Sorcerers, but nothing got the right balance between magic and martial, as well as their signature ability to teleport to a guarded ally and strike the attacker. 

Artificers though, they have the tools needed to make one hell of a great sword mage, with a subclass similar to BattleSmith, but a focus on teleportation instead of the pet. 

One thing to keep in mind on Aegis. Because you only have 2 infusions to start, you often will only have one target you can use the reaction on until higher levels. This also gives it some nice scaling, eventually protecting 4-5 people in tier 4. 

EDIT: The Intent on signature weapon is to be able to switch the chosen cantrips each long rest. When I combined the two abilities I lost that line. 


Compared to the last version, this should be a bit cleaner, a bit more ""artificer-y"", and a bit nerfed at later levels
I am torn on whether to put the Teleportation Boost ability at level 9 or level 15, I dont want to make 9 too complex, but it feels late getting it a 15. Thoughts?

692,fxfi1jq,ho2hkm,"Hi! This is my first attempt at writing a variant rule.

You can find the GM link [here](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MBlOsZ7EWTj9ZdtoWO5).  As always, feedback is appreciated. If you decide to use this homebrew in your own campaign, I would greatly appreciate it if you post or message me what you thought it was like.

The following are answers to anticipated questions:

**Why remove Intimidation?** Currently, I see intimidation being used in one of two ways. Verbally, as a threat, or physically, with a use of force. With this variant, you would use CHA or STR Persuasion, depending on if your threat is verbal or physical in nature, respectively. Someone who is good with words would whisper a blackmail, while someone who is strong will push you to the ground.

**Why remove Deception?** This one isn't so clear-cut. Should you have to dedicate a skill to being a good liar, but not necessarily to being a good persuader? I see this going both ways, but my answer is no. If you are good at speaking (or with this variant, good at communicating with your own style), then you will likely be a decent liar in that style. A goliath who shoves a waiter to the ground yelling ""I DON'T LIKE SOUP"" will be believed from his actions, even if he doesn't like soup. A bard that lies about their identity is putting on a show, and sounds just as convincing if they were lying or not.

**Why remove Performance?** I didn't write it in, out of fear of sparking more controversy, but I think the performance skill should be removed as well. Performance is used in one of the following ways: some hand-eye coordination performance, such as juggling (sleight of hand), jumps and flips (acrobatics), an instrument performance (instrument tools check using dex), or spoken jokes, songs, or stories, which I think are a niche of Charisma (Persuasion).

**Will this make Charisma weak?**  I don't think it will. Of the 13 official classes, 9 are spellcasters, and 4 use Charisma, making it the most commonly used mental skill. Charisma persuasion will also most likely remain the ""default"" social skill for most small interactions that the DM calls for, while others (pinning someone, holding a blade, arguing in court) are unique and flavorful but not necessarily always appropriate.

**Will this make Dexterity strong(er)?** My approach to this variant skills is you can use any attribute score, but that doesn't necessarily make it appropriate. Dex and Str persuasion checks in particular will commonly cause a scene (holding a blade to someone's neck or pinning them to a wall), which will trigger adverse effects or set a higher DC. Of the examples given, Dex persuasion is even less common than Strength persuasion, the latter which currently utilizes Intimidation. For this reason, I anticipate that Charisma will remain as the 'default' check. You can still intimidate with charisma, if you use your words rather than your actions.",UnearthedArcana,Variant Rule: Persuasion checks | Diversify social interactions,Mechanic

As the title suggests, its a  class for those who wish to fight side by side a their best friend,  their companion.  Its inspiration origination does come from the beast  master subclass.  However, I never did like it, as I thought there could be so much more to a character who has a companion than 'just' a  ranger.  Beast masters appear in various forms throughout pop culture,  and I wanted to capture part of that essence.

Namely,  the companion should take on a greater role during character development and advancement.  I offer that by unlocking new companion traits depending on what type of companion the player wants.  Also, if the play doesn't like what I presented in terms of options, they should work with their DM to create an appropriate stat block representative of that genus/family.  For example, a lizard friend may be semi-aquatic, but I did not present an amphibious companion.

Additionally, I've added 4 subclasses.  Each drawing inspiration from different sources.  Potentially, the player is more druidic, into bear cavalry, or pursuer or dragons.

### Common Questions & Design Notes:

> What is this? It's nothing like the new UA Artificer!

That's true, this was originally adapted from the original UA Artificer, and can be thought of as a spiritual successor to that. Originally I had planned to merge it back into the UA Version, but the UA Verison went in a substantially different direction with the newest release. While some people like the new UA Artificer's direction, it's new direction and approach doesn't suit everyone.

That's why I've updated the name from ""Revised Artificer"" to ""Kibbles Alternate Artificer"" as it's started its path to be a standalone thing. In 2.0 it will move slightly more toward it's own thing, but that's for the future.

> This is incredibly long!

That's not a question, but yes, it is. Generally speaking as a player or a DM, you aren't going to need to worry about every subclass or even every upgrade. It has been arranged now that you can look ahead to the upgrades you can select at any given level, but at the end of the day the level of customization inherent to an Artificer makes it a bit more complicated to make. My fundamental design philosophy is that the end result of that process should play at the table like a 5e character, and from there the process of making the character can be a little bit more flexible.

> Cannonsmiths do a ton of damage!

Again... not a question :) One of the most common reactions is that Cannonsmith damage is high due to having an unrestricted Sneak Attack damage progression. However, Rogues are also intended to get Sneak Attack every turn, and Sneak Attack damage is actually quite closely aligned to the damage of over classes. Even compared to Rogues, a Rogue will still come out with slightly higher damage even accounting for Upgrades due their easy access to Advantage.

Change Log v1.7:

### 1.7 Changes

* All Expanded Toolbox spells moved to the main document as they have been extensively playtested.

* Ordered all upgrades by their level restriction in tiers of unrestricted, 5th, 9th, 11th, and 15th. Organized all upgrade restrictions to one of those levels.

* Magic Item analysis spells no longer require material components.

* Lots of spelling and grammar clarifications/fixes.

* Added more notations/design notes, including my guidance on if Warplate can be made out of magical armor (RAW, no, but I personally allow it the rules for how I allow it).

* Note on how you want to fluff your Artificer's magic.

* Added the creating your Artificer fluff to an appendix at the end.

* Added new spell, Lightning Charged

#### Cannonsmith

* Expanded Magazine removed; autoloading magazine now has 5th level preqrequisite and does not require expanded magazine.

* Taking the Silencer upgrade now allows you to cast *silence*. This is mostly added to help people understand that it's well, magical. Obviously dampening the sound of Thunder damage is a ridiculous notion on the face of it, the upgrade exists to make the weapon more viable for more playstyles.

* Added Stabilization and Blast Radius to the 11th level upgrade slot.

#### Gadgetsmith

* Gravity Switch moved back to main document now that it has proper rules via *fall* spell.

* Added Autonomous Crossbow

* Lightning Generator now allows you to add your Intelligence modifier to lightning damage dealt on your turn.

#### Golemsmith

* Added Shielding Bond from Expanded Toolbox as 5th level upgrade.

* Intelligence and Wisdom granted by Mark of Life increased to 10.

#### Infusionsmith

* For Animated Weapons, the range was increased to 40 feet, while the ranged of Heavy Weapons was reduced to 20 feet and the range of Light weapons was increased to 60 feet. This makes the choice of what kind of weapon to use somewhat more interesting, and provides benefits for using lighter weapons.

* You can now switch your animated weapon with a 10 minute ritual during the day.

#### Potionsmith

* Added Alchemical Homunculus upgrade.

* Added Empowered Homunculus.

* Healing Draught's decay at the start of your next turn, rather than the end of your turn. This allows allies to use their action to drink them if they are passed off with an object interaction. They 
still require a bonus action to create, so it you still would not be able to create more than one, and the overall action economy cost is unchanged.

* Infusion Expertize slightly buffed to be a short or long rest (instead of only short). Many people were playing this way anyway.

* The Philosopher's Stone can be used to replace a Diamond of 500gp or less as a spell material component, and is not consumed when used in such a way.

#### Warsmith

* Mechplate renamed to Warplate - this is just a cosmetic change. Your Warplate can still be Mechplate, but the term seemed to trouble some people, and was never intended to indicate the nature of special plate, just to differentiate it from normal plate armor. How mechanical vs magical your Artificer is is entirely up to the player and DM about what fits their setting.

* Added Ether Reactor from the Expanded Toolbox as an 11th level upgrade.

If you want more Artificer, feel free to check out the **[Expanded Toolbox](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LR85y6FKnWhRAWIJgSP)** for my playtest content, as well where I put some of the more peculiar upgrades. Please note I do not recommend the Expanded Toolbox unless you are comfortable with some degree of ad hoc balance. While the main Artificer is very heavily playtested, the Expanded Toolbox is less so! Note, a the time of the posting, the new version of Expanded Toolbox is in progress.

**Do you have a Custom Upgrade you use on your Artificer that you want to share?** Now's the time! I'm rebuilding the Expanded Toolbox after a lot of it's content was moved to the main document, and will be adding a lot of new upgrades and spells to in the next week or so. While I don't promise yours will make it in, I always love hearing what people have done! Also, if there are legacy 3.5 Artificer spells you want to see ported, I'll be reviewing those again to see if there's anymore I want to bring over.

696,erb7329,bc0osd,"To my view, a Warsmith is has fairly high damage and utility, but less durability than a Fighter or Barbarian, and that's fine, but if you invest a lot of upgrades defensively, they can get extremely durable. Early game (before you have more upgrades) *arcane ablation* is a very good mitigation spell at lower levels.

Upgrades Ablative Armor + Self Repair Matrix were added specifically to make the Piloted Golem extremely durable if the Warsmith wanted to invest in that. Piloted Golem + Ablative Armor + Self Repait Matrix + Defensive Structuring + Armor Class x3 + Reactive Plating will mean that a Warsmith that maximizes defenses will be probably be more durable than pretty much any PC outside of maybe a Barbarian though, even with their d8. I think its far that to get there, they'd have to give up a fair bit of the utility and offense, as if they were good at defense/offense and utility, they'd be too much.

There are several people that tell me the Warsmith is too durable when maximizing the path already; a d10 hit die (or a +1 hp per level) would have to be a feature power from somewhere, and I think would make a less interesting upgrade than their current defensive options.

Hope that helps, let me know if you have any questions.

A long time ago in a world that seems so very distant from today, Wizards of the Coast posted a Sorcerer subclass called Stone Sorcery to UA, and the people rejoiced, for it was interesting and different. However, as time passed and the world became as we know it today, there was to be no joy and Stone Sorcery was lost to the annuals of history... and the hearts of many.

Thus is born the Stoneheart Sorcerer presented here. It's not quite the original for a few reasons, but generally I wanted to capture the same idea. If you want to give the Paladin smites, I don't think that's particularly unreasonable, but I decided to remove them in favor of a more traditional list, though included a new spell that largely functions as one; and I think that the idea could be developed more with more gish spells, I just don't know if looting the Paladin list makes the most thematic sense, though if you and your DM are fine with it, you could always give it a go.

While these spells are quite good, the original had issues with them due to (a) concentration (which a gish can never have enough of) and (b) limited sorcerer spells known.

The likely most controversial change will be around Stone's Aegis as you can no longer teleport to an attacked target and attack the attacker as your reaction, but in exchange you can be the target of your own aegis. The original one tended to have some strange interactions, and left the Stone Sorcerer themselves in an odd spot, as they weren't particularly tanky, but they also de facto made themselves the target because they got a free attack when you hit anything else... particularly true as a Sorcerer gish tends to rely on the reaction to cast the *shield* spell, and you spent your reaction attacking. Ultimately this lead to quite a lot of dead Stone Sorcerers. This is revision intended to help smooth out their experience a little, and so far has tested well in allowing them to be a bit more of well rounded gish.

All in all, it is toned down from the original, as while the original was a little awkward to pilot, it tended be very strong with certain popular multiclass set ups in particular; the goal of this is to stand on its own a little better and be less generally dependent on multiclassing out for viability.

It's actually already been out there for playtesting for a bit, but I'm always happy to hear thoughts and feedback for polishing this stone sorcerer up!

For some that have followed my stuff, not all of these spells are actually new - *orbital stones* and *earth ripple* are old favorites, and *impact* was pulled from [my Occultist](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-M-WtrKeZNFdEXq0MKXw), but they are all spells that felt at home here, so decided to add them in here along with the new ones :)

705,g49buq0,inrvoa,"GM Binder link [here](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-M9FiW7uAkkrU_K1HR-a), previous (2.0) thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/gwmukm/druid_circle_of_the_sun_for_druids_that_celebrate/)!

**Overview**

Animals have the Moon, and Fungi have Spores. With the Circle of the Sun, I wanted to represent the last (and my personal favorite) major kingdom: Plants! And no, Land definitely doesn’t cover it!

**Goals**

With this subclass, I chose **diversity** and **hardiness** as themes...because plants!

- **Diversity.** This should be druid versatile and each one should feel unique. 
- **Hardiness.** This druid should have staying power.
- **Plant-based.** This druid should be rewarded for choosing plant-based spells. Buffing staple plant-based spells should feel like a nudge and not a drag.

**Changes**

The feedback with 2.0 was invaluable! Bloom, as the centerpiece of the subclass, certainly needed some tweaks. 

- **Bloom.** As a feature, I really wanted to make this work. I've chosen to keep the basic Bloom mechanics in 2.5, and here are some thoughts that I had after the feedback from 2.0: 

   - On **wild shape alternatives as a concept**: With Bloom, I really wanted to create a novel way for wild shape to be used. With Spore and Stars, druids get an alternate transformation. For Wildfire, it’s a summon. For Sun druids, I wanted wild shape to enable flexible spell choice/casting without just adding a circle spell list (like in Land). Kind of like Bard-lite.

   - On **spell slots**: I’ll concede that the expenditure of wild shape and a spell slot is a heavy tax on a druid. In writing 2.0 and mulling over the feedback from /u/leuku, I also realized that if no slots are expended, a Sun druid can’t up-cast a bloom spell. If Fireball is your bloom spell and it requires no slot, you’re either stuck with a 3rd level spell or confused. I think I found a good compromise here in making 1st and 2nd level spells “free” with Bloom at 10th level. 

   - On **spell choice**: A lot of people have brought up that giving a druid access to high level arcane spells like Wish might step on the toes of other classes. But what I’ll mention is that druids are currently the only full caster completely incapable of using Wish (which is the example that most have used)—Arcana clerics can pick it up at their subclass capstone and now Genie warlocks have it too. One of the main changes is the removal of the ‘action casting time’ restriction entirely. Then wild shape can just be expended in whatever casting time the chosen spell dictates. The ability to pickup Counterspell and Mass Healing Word is a treat on its own, and in the heat of the moment worth the price of a Wild Shape *and* a slot! Someone also made a good point about a plant druid casting necromancy spells, so I inserted the “no necromancy” restriction.

   Some have said “No one would waste a Wild Shape *and* a spell slot on a bloom spell.” But certainly a Sun druid can still use Wild Shape in the traditional manner anytime he/she’s like—it just means one less bloom spell use until a short rest.

- **Firmly Planted.** Clarified the language!

**Potential Problems**

- **Bloom (duh).** Free 1st and 2nd level spells at the cost of a wild shape doesn’t seem too bad, but choosing 10th level for it to come online was a little arbitrary. 6th? 14th? Also I just realized the typo saying ""either"" in the last line.
- ***Thorn Whip* Flourish.** Should I add a ""...you don't need to make an attack roll to pull the creature,"" clarification in there?
- **Witherless.** Hit point regain amount? Still fiddling with this. Since it’s the capstone, I’d like to make it useful.

706,g39yhgf,iiz8vr,"Hey all, getting around to making some updates to The Shaman in light of some great playtest feedback I’ve received.

With so many attempts at creating a Shaman (Nature Bruiser) class, I think it highlights a missing archetype in the officially published 5e classes. Someone who is in-tune with the natural world, but more offensive and able to take hits (unlike the Druid). I've always been a fan of the unique spellcasting and structure of the Warlock class, so I chose to fulfill the Shaman fantasy on the Warlock chassis.

The class is based on the Warlock class, with totems replacing eldritch invocations and slot casting similar to pact magic. However, where the Warlock is focused mostly on damage, the Shaman is focused on terrain manipulation, tanking hits, and supporting your allies. The Shaman's totems themselves are based on monster abilities found in the 5th edition Monster Manual.

The spell list is focused mostly on terrain manipulation, some elemental spells, and buff spells.

The Subclasses:

* The Curse-Binder: focus on de-buffing your enemies and defending yourself against magic. 
* The Spirit-Warrior: The martial subclass. Gets special enhancements to their weapons and abilities based on spirits. 
* The Witch-Doctor: Gains access to potent healing and buff abilities for their allies and themselves.

Here are some nice PDF links:

* [The Shaman on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10AMCokrUCcneqI_V54XOF99PrlpLCM1Z/view?usp=sharing)

# Change Log:

* Updated the class with some really nice art - all from *Magic the Gathering*!

* Constitution is no longer a requirement for multiclassing.

* Ritual Casting has been clarified.

* New 1st level feature - Sacred Technique.

* Subclasses are now chosen at 3rd level, and Spirituality Spells begin at 3rd level with 2nd-level spells.

* Major update to the Curse-Binder subclass. You now inflict curses upon your enemies - with four curse options.

* Spirit-Warrior language has been clarified.

* Minor update to the Witch-Doctor subclass abilities at 3rd and 14th levels.

* Totem of the Earthquake is now a “smite” like ability.

* Totems of the Vine, Hunt, and Winter Court have had language clarifications.

* Added Totem of the Serpent.

* Removed Totem of Bloodlust and Totem of Moon.

* **Spirit-Warrior.** I think you hit the nail on the head with your critique of this subclass, and I've done a revision on most of its features. Check it out and let me know what you think!

* Consider *compelled duel* added to the Shaman spell list. It was originally a Spirit-Warrior Spirituality Spell back when you selected your Spirituality at 1st level.

* I also ended up moving some of the Totems to the 6th level spirituality features. Curse-Binder now gets Potent Spellcasting, the Spirit-Warrior gets Extra Attack, and the Witch-Doctor gets Empowered Strike (Divine Strike). The features that were there became Totems exclusive to the respective spiritualities.

* Totem of the Harvest is spontaneous. I thought it was flavorful/funny. *""Hey Reginald, you have berries growing in your beard again.""*

* I agree with the typical homebrew class bloat as far as Invocations/Totems go. The only time I'll be adding more is when I add new spiritualities since they'll need their own exclusive Totems.

I would like to note that this is not an original idea. This is a common idea, and has even been talked about by the D&D Designers in Happy Fun Hour back in the day. Quite possible this template has already been posted in some form or another, but in a quick search I didn't find it on /r/UnearthedArcana, though I recall seeing something similar at one point.

I'm posting this because when talking about making a crafting system, I mentioned that I used the weapon builder template a preface, and many people were interested in it, so I thought I'd share the template that I personally use, as well the Not-So-Common items I frequently strew about my game world for those special-snow flakes out there that don't want a weapon directly off the rack at the shop :)

#### Additional Notes and FAQ:

> Why are katanas a Finesse weapon?

Look, we can debate this one to the cows are all eaten by griffons, but it's that way because that's what people that want to use katana want them to be. If you want more historical accuracy, you can always just a longsword called a katana.

> Some of these weapons are overpowered!

Some of these weapons are better for some builds than the weapons in the PHB. That is why I put the guard rails on them saying that they are at the DMs discretion and not necessarily starting gear. **But** they are mostly not better than a +1 weapon, Uncommon loot. These fit great in with ""masterwork"" weapons or other midtier upgrades; something that can be cool for your players to find or make without being a magic weapon.

Magic weapon versions of these may exist, but of course, at the DMs discretion.

> Why are ranged weapons aren't included?

Because this was part of my guide to blacksmithing, but also because ranged weapons don't really have any properties missing. Ranged weapons already have all the results of their template.

> Special Properties? Exotic Weapons??

Calm down, ye rambunctiuos adventurer. I may continue this into things that are *not* easily a result of the template (weapons with the special property) if there is interest in it, or even exotic weapons, but that gets into actual homebrewing, while this is more of just sharing a tool/idea and some of the things I've done with it. If you'd like to see something down this route, let me know.

710,ezunho4,d2g3l3,"Hello again everyone,

Today I come with the Sōhei martial archetype for fighter!

This is a first for me, a subclass that is completely nonmagical! I think every other subclass I have made so far has had magical influence in some way. So this was kind of hard for me to come up with. In all honesty, I think the official options represent a great spread for completely martial fighters and it is not really necessary to have more nonmagical options, but it was really fun making this and I think others will enjoy playing with it as well.

A design constraint I had for this was to have something they can use at will, as the base fighter tends to not have a lot of diverse options, and I didn't want to make a different version of battle master. I also wanted to keep it open to melee and ranged characters, though I envision it (and historically it is mostly) a melee fighter.

Anyway, more formats:

Here are some tips with the slightly unsettling College of Mime:

\- Copycat can be read as ""one stealth check per long rest"". It's an outstanding way of stealing your allies' thunder and skill, and deadly potent when it does it.

\- Magical Hoodwink is a deceptively powerful feature. It scales from about -2.5 to -5 to a saving throw. That makes all your deceptions, illusions, feebleminds, and more, utterly crippling. You can turn fights by means of this feature, especially if your foes lack legendary resistances at early levels, or once your spells are strong at later ones

\- Mental conjuration has bottomless uses, and the best one will always be ""leaving an invisible wall in the path of your foe, so they run into it""

\- The mayhem you can cause with Spell Ventriloquy is truly bard-tastic. At least one war probably got started by some evil plotter exploiting this feature

I also think it's generally a little odd to separate spell selection based on schools when you're taking from a caster that isn't a wizard. For the most part, spell schools seem to be a distinction for those who academically study magic rather than how clerics would distinguish it. But that being said, I do like the choice of abjuration/divination for a transcendent monk if that's the direction you're going.

Eldritch Knight gets their ""enemy disadvantage on spell saving throw"" feature at 10th level and Arcane Tricksters get theirs at 9th. I feel like it'd be more reasonable for the Monk to get theirs one level late with their 11th level feature instead of 3-4 levels early with their 6th level.

There is a lot of minor tweaks, but the major change hits Infusionsmith. I was admittedly reluctant to pull the trigger on a change this large to an established and popular subclass, but the vast majority of the playtest feedback was pointing to this needing to happen. Essentially, the Infusionsmith's attacks are now entirely centered around Animated Weapon, getting it at level 1 and getting a 2nd at level 5. This seems to be a much stronger and more consistent thematic for them, as well as hopefully will eliminate confusion by moving them to using spell attacks. If you loved the sword-and-sworcery approach some people took the class down, consider looking at the Upgrades in the Expanded Toolbox; like with the other subclasses, support for that branch of playstyle is now supported via upgrades (these will probably be tweaked as more feedback comes in for the new version, but sincerely believe all players will be happier with this change in the long run).

Speaking of which... [**The Expanded Toolbox**](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LR85y6FKnWhRAWIJgSP). What is in this?

* Additional Upgrades for all subclasses (including the Wandsmith... technically).

* More room for speculative/niche upgrades means that there is some stranger stuff, as I go through porting in community ideas and some of the odder notes I've tucked away for ideas, expect this to only get more inclusive of the eccentric.

* The next iteration of the Mindsmith. The previous feedback was that it was ""too much just a telepath"" - this is still probably true, but its slowly moving toward more being telepathic gadgets instead of just telepathic abilities.

* The Fleshsmith in it's first appearence. I had not planned on pulling the trigger on this one yet, but someone asked about it, so here we are. This class is an Artificer that has turned their creative talents to a rigorous path of self improvement... and occasionally improvement of their Adorable Critter. Bursting with vitality, they excel at staying healthy, sharing their health, and delivering not insignificant amounts of beatdown. They are probably going to be adjusted! This is the first time this one has been published.

* A few Feats for the Artificers (or Warforged) in your game. I will probably add more as time goes on here.

* **The Expanded Toolbox will grow.** If you have an idea for it, please post it in the thread. Not everything will get added, but I am going to be a lot more lenient about adding things from the community here. Already some things from community users have been added.

*Disclaimer! Do not feel the need to add the Expanded Toolbox to your game! If you feel there is already too much Artificer in Revised Artificer, do not click the link! If you seek only the polished content I strive for with Revised Artificer, beware! This is essentially my own testing content published!*

## 1.6 Changes

## Cannonsmith

* Blast Shells replaced by Mortar Shells; always deals half thunder monger damage, but goes over cover.

* Storm Burst now does 1d6 + half of Thundermonger bonus damage (up from just half of Thundermonger bonus damage).

* Overload Capacitor has been removed. It was a controversial upgrade that wasn't as good as it seemed, and ended up causing more hassle than it was worth.

* Removed Snap Fire upgrade; this upgrade has always been a bit awkward and niche and was not popularly selected.

* Added Terrifying Thunder upgrade.

## Gadgetsmith changes

* Added Arcane Nullifier.

* Removed Zombie Wires (moved to Expanded Toolbox). This was a niche upgrade that was rarely used.

## Potionsmith Changes

* Clarified interaction between Fortifying Fumes Reaction and Empowered Alchemy - you can add your Intelligence modifier to temporary hitpoints granted by Reactions or Infusions.

* Aroma Therapy was altered; it now recovers 2d4 hit dice and 1d4 levels of exhaustion instead of all missing hit dice. It still fills the 'recover faster' niche, but now longer as impactful to hit dice at later levels, though arguably the exhaustion recovery is even better, it means it has a more solid niche and interacts more with class mechanics.

## Warsmith Changes

* Integrated Weapon and Integrated attack have been merged, but has been moved to 11th level required.

* Flight has been moved 11th level required.

## Infusionsmith Changes

* Infusionsmith has recieved a substantial change, moving their attacks pretty much entirely to the animated weapon. It seems like a more pure and thematic expression of the subclass that people wanted to play, and removes confusion.

* Replaced Infused Weapon with Animated Weapon; change animated weapon to be an independent spell attack.

* Add Twin Animated Weapon at 5th level to replace Animated Weapon (now at first level).

* Removed Shielding Ring upgrade. (moved to Expanded Toolbox); this was sort of redundant with the new version of Dancing Blades.

* Changed Dancing Weapon significantly; now works against 1 attack and instantly counterattacks using reaction. Renamed Deflecting Weapon.

* Removed Boots of Flying, added Enchant Broom (slightly more flavorful version of flying, available earlier at level 11).

* Arcane Armament no longer grants temporary hitpoints, and is now AC + Intelligence again, though explicitly does not stack with anything else that adds your Intelligence to your Armor (Bladesingers. This is because of god damn Bladesingers).

* Added Quick Infusions.

* Added Malicious Infusion.

* Added Elemental Infusions.

* Updated the range of aura.

* Added secondary effect to constant Vigilence (thanks to /u/SwEcky for a particularly creative mechanic here).

* Fixed some typos.

# Why?

Because your party will encounter 28 NPCs far faster than they will get through 28 different party members.

And there should be more enemy adventurer statblocks. While the MM and Volo's include many adventurer statblocks, there aren't any that cover the range of options available in Xanathar's, many of which would make for really interesting enemies to fight.

# How?

None of these are faithful representations of everything the subclass can do. Many of their abilities are mixed and matched from low-level and high-level features of the class pretty much as I saw fit. I ignored most ribbons and removed a lot of limitations (as there's no need to ""balance"" a monster statblock).

For example, storm sorcerers get limited flight, while the storm sorcerer NPC statblock can fly at will.

In the spirit of these changes I also limited myself to a single-column statblock for each. It would be easy to bog each one down with a million abilities and stipulations on those abilities, but I resisted the temptation.

In sum, the changes made are all quality-of-life changes for a DM running the monster, and they hopefully make the statblocks fairly straightforward to read. It also, helpfully, diversifies the challenge ratings.",UnearthedArcana,"Every subclass in Xanathar's Guide to Everything converted to an NPC statblock for your party to get killed by.

A proposition, and what I probably will use at my table. The changes summarize to:  
1. Less random complications. The higher the spell level, the more likely it is to get the worse complications (like spell loss), which are very rare on lower level spell research.  
2. Easier time getting research credits, which have less averaged bonuses, and scale with the wizard's Arcana bonus.

If you liked them, please be aware that I updated the [gmbinder](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-M9FSF3qmdRa2_wO1nY4) file based on the feedback.

It feels like a dream, but somehow, we’ve been doing this Flashpoint Friday thing for a whole month now, and after seeing all the feedback, I’ve decided to keep a semi-regular schedule. Each month, I’ll do a Subclass, a Creature, some Magic Items, and then something random. So, with that said, we’re here with a sorcerer subclass, the Split Soul!

I’m a huge fan of familiars. It’s partly because I spend way too much time playing with my dog and wishing we could talk to each other… but really it comes down to how much mechanical benefit you can get from a familiar in 5e. Help actions, scouting, RP moments. I love it. With the Split Soul Sorcerer, you take a familiar and literally make it a part of yourself. The two of you share a soul and use that special bond to create a truly unique skillset.

Oathbreaker meets Monk? With all the power and none of the restraint, these brawlers are wandering disappointment to their teachers everywhere.

This monk is MAD as hell (or at least, optionally so if you want to go a bit into strength) but has some more support for that - and not just the thematic kind for their attitude. An all rounder that focuses on improving a monks grappling, tankiness, and adding a good dollop of bad attitude on top.

Some notes:

* The light armor will produce less AC than a normal monk in almost all cases. It really just exists to allow Strength as an option.

* Soak it Up looks good, but keep in mind they are are very unlikely to have more than +2/+3 to Con.

* Lean Into It would be insane at lower levels, but Monks tend to fall off in damage a bit as is. It's possible it's still too much though, and I may tie it to only Flurry of Blows hits or something.

This subclass was the first that I've made based on a suggestion, and I think it was a fun little side project, and will be a fun addition to the list moving forward.

​ This spell is balanced around taking heat metal, and letting it affect every item you can hold. I then made the disarming part the focus of the spell, rather than making the damage the focus of the spell. For some casters, this can be a great alternative to silence, and a the fact the spell is a spell attack gives you a plethora of ways to be sure that it lands.

I designed this to be weak against most foes, but incredible versus, say, a lich with legendary resistances ~~and fragments of his soul stashed away in six trinkets, a snake, and a scar.~~

This one's a bit interesting, and definitely not something I'd recommend building in a vacuum.  But it seemed to me that the ""protector-guide"" ranger archetype is missing from the official stuff, so I thought I'd do a reverse-beastmaster and tie the features of the subclass to finding and protecting a spellcaster buddy.

The other thing I wanted to play with here is an armored ranger.  Heavy armor isn't in the ranger chassis (mostly because they can't sneak in it) but I feel like it fits the protector here.  It also allows the ranger to spec into strength, melee and AC rather than being heavily slanted towards dexterity and ranged attacks.  I also felt that the War Magic feature would be fairly interesting in this subclass, as the ""bond"" provides the ranger with arcane magic power, though this ranger gets it at 11th rather than 7th, so it doesn't conflict so much with Extra Attack.

Features:

* The bond: a psychic link with your caster that provides status information and a part of the caster's power to the ranger
* Strength ranger promoted through heavy armor proficiency and features encouraging melee combat.  
* Offensive reaction to your caster buddy makes you want to stay close.
* Cantrips and bonus magic at 7th, when rangers usually get a defensive ability.  This is a little outside of standard ranger subclass design, but it fits the theme of the bond providing magical power
* War Magic at 11th level as the tier 3-4 power boost
* 15th is usually a strong ranger reaction ability, but I used the L3 to grant a reaction ability.  Instead, I added a defensive feature (usually an L7)

Changelog from [1.1](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/d28xsj/witchguard_conclave_a_ranger_subclass_sworn_and/):

* Fixed granting *aid* before you can cast it. Whoops!
* L3 reaction ability range increases with level, since ""staying close"" is more and more difficult as PCs level up and become more mobile.
* Removed defensive L3 reaction as a bit too complex - it had a nice flavor but I felt it was too mechanically complex.  
* Cleaned up the L7 language.
* 15th changed from improving the reaction ability (again, the ability felt fiddly) to instead provide defense against spells, right when a martial really needs it.

**EDIT: The PDF and GMB have been updated to version 1.2a** based on feedback from this post.  Thanks for all the comments - I'm quite amazed by the response to this class.  Changes:

* L3: removed ignore stealth disadvantage (I want to use this as a ribbon sometime, but it's not really necessary or thematic to the WG)
* L3: the WG now imposes disadvantage on attacks against the ward while it is close (adding a defensive element)
* L3: the WG only makes the reaction attack when the ward casts a leveled spell (reducing the incidence of the reaction attack, which felt too common for a lot of critics and reduces the synergy with a cantrip-heavy melee ward like the Arcane Trickster, Bladesinger, or Hexblade)
* L15: Spellshield Bond now shares the best of CIW saves between both ward/warder. I think making it full save coverage would be a bit overboard (ward would get Str/Dex proficiency++), but this basically grants a second save proficiency++ for a Charisma or Intelligence caster, and probably improves the ward's Wisdom save.",UnearthedArcana,"Witchguard Conclave (v.1.2): a ranger archetype sworn and bonded to protect a single caster, inspired by the Warders and Rashemi dajemma",Subclass

# Pact of the Casket

Brand new warlock's pact boon, heavily inspired by the amazing ""Ava's Demon"" web comic by Michelle Czajkowski!

## Pact of the Casket

You have been gifted with an extradimensional container embedded within your body, that is linked directly to your patron's home realm. It can appear as a wooden or metallic casket, or as a bottomless hollow or mouth inside of your chest, depending on nature and character of your patron.

This casket has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 1 foot in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. Only you can open and access the casket. The casket can hold up to 800 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. Retrieving an item from the casket requires an action. Any object or a creature within the casket is protected from all sorts of divination magic, and is considered screened by a thin sheet of lead. Breathing creatures inside the casket can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate. Attempting to place a bag of holding, Heward's handy haversack, portable hole or a similar item inside the casket's extradimensional space results in the item being spit out of the casket immediately.

Your DM may have your patron give you an object, including magic items, via the casket. This item can be anything that helps you communicate with your patron or achieve your goal, such as a temporary sending stone, match of which is at your patron's disposal, a potion or a spell scroll. It must fit within the casket's maximum interior space, but other objects placed inside of the casket to not obstruct its deployment. When you receive an item from your patron in this way, a mental alarm notifies you with a ping in your mind when you receive an item in this way. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.

Additionally, you can perform a special hour-long ritual and expend a warlock spell slot of 1st level or higher to request an object from your patron. The requested item must not exceed 100 gp in value (+ additional 100 gp per slot level above 1st), and your patron must be able and willing to give you the requested item. The item is fully functional, but it is visibly deformed by your patron's magic and is considered consecrated or desecrated (depending on your patron). Any attempt to sell the gifted item causes it to crumble to ash. You can only have one such item at a time, and requesting a new item causes the former one to disappear. Once you've used this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Eldritch invocations

Invocations are early WIP so far, beware!

## Expanded Vessel

*Prerequisite:* 12th level, Pact of the Casket feature

* Your casket's interior space and weight holding capacity are doubled. Breathing creatures inside the casket can now survive for an unlimited amount of time without suffocating.
* The maximum value of the requested object increases by 225 gp per slot level above 1st, instead of 100 gp, up to a maximum of 1000 gp.

## Eldritch Bestowal

*Prerequisite:* 7th level, Pact of the Casket feature

* Whenever you finish a long rest, you may request a magic scroll of your choice from your patron. The chosen spell must be from warlock's spell list and of 1st or 2nd level and must have a casting time of 1 action. Once in the scroll, the spell’s power is enhanced, counting as one level higher than normal. You can cast the spell from the scroll by reading it as an action. The scroll vanishes when you use it or when you finish your next long rest.

## Vortex Exile

*Prerequisite:* 7th level, Pact of the Casket feature

* As an action, you can open the casket and point at a creature that is Medium or smaller, casting *banishment* at 4th level on it, requiring no material components. On a failed save, the creature is sucked into a temporary extradimensional prison created within depths of your casket. Regardless of its native plane of existence, once the spell ends, the target reappears in an unoccupied space of your choosing within 30 feet of you. If the target is willing, or if it's unwilling and its CR is 2 or lower, you can concentrate on the spell for up to 8 hours and keep the target within your casket. Once you've cast this spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

## Eldritch Inquiry

*Prerequisite:* Pact of the Casket feature

* You gain the benefits of the *identify* spell on any object stored within the casket for at least 10 minutes. Additionally, you learn if the object is consecrated or desecrated.

## Unholy Casket

*Prerequisite:* 7th level, Pact of the Casket feature

* You learn the *summon greater demon* spell, if you don't already know it. The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known. You can cast this spell without expending a spell slot once, by opening the casket and releasing a cloud of dark substance, which flows out and warps into the demon. Once you've cast this spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

## Weapon Bond

*Prerequisite:* Pact of the Casket feature

* You can bond one weapon to the casket by performing a special ritual while you keep the weapon within the casket. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. If the bonded weapon is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more, it appears within the casket. It must fit within the casket's maximum interior space, but other objects placed inside of the casket do not obstruct its emergence. You lose your bond with the weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it.

## Fortified Vessel

*Prerequisite:* 5th level, Pact of the Casket feature

* When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 12 + your Charisma modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.

## Wondrous Mischief

*Prerequisite:* 5th level, Pact of the Casket feature, Archfey or Celestial otherwordly patron

* As an action, you can fling open the casket and release a flock of tiny spirits from your patron's home realm. You cast the *spirit guardians* spell, requiring no spell slot or material components. Once you've cast the spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.",UnearthedArcana,"The Pact of the Casket! - An extraplanar magical storage, linked directly to your patron's domain",Subclass

# Sorcerous Origins

**Emberheart.** Whether you are descended from an Efreeti or were born near a portal to the Elemental Plane of Fire, you bear a spark of primordial flame within you that allows you to manipulate fire magic! (*Elemental Adept: Fire strongly recommended*)

**Stoneblood.** A rock-solid take on a melee Sorcerer. Enter your elemental form and smash your foes with rock fists. You can also protect your allies too! Based on the old UA: Stone Sorcerer.

**Stormsoul.** A reimagining of the Storm Sorcerer from the *Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide* that brings it in-line with the rest of the Sorcerer subclasses and makes it actually fun! Thunderbolts and Lightning, very *very* frightening.

**Waveborn.** Send your foes to a watery grave with the curse-slinging water sorcerer! Based on crowd control and limiting your foes’ movement. Based on the old UA: Sea Sorcerer.

**Divine Right.** Considering how much real humans obsess over bloodlines it isn’t a stretch to imagine a Royal Sorcerer bloodline! Command your allies and dominate your foes. Choose a Divine Mark that will exemplify your type of leadership!

**Faeblood.** You see, when an Archfey and a human love each other *very* much… I know Wild Magic is *technically* an option for a Fey sorcerer, but I just love the Feywild so much I felt that there could be an explicitly Fey Sorcerous Origin. Leans into the enchanting nature of the Fey by giving you access to the Bard spell list in the same way the Divine Soul has access to the Cleric spell list.

**Mystic.** *Gasp*, the UA class that shall not be named! I’m as saddened as the rest of us that it seems like we won’t be getting a Mystic/Psion/Psychic class anytime soon. With the inclusion of the Aberrant Mind in *TCoE*, I decided to try cramming the entire UA: Mystic into a Sorcerous Origin. (*Warning: Results May Vary*)

**Psionicist.** Another Psionic Sorcerous Origin! This is your “pure” psychic Sorcerer. Aberrant Mind really leaned into the eldritch horror aspect of psionics (it is an awesome subclass). The Psionicist is basically “Draconic Bloodline but with Psychic damage).

____

Phew, that was a lot of self promotion to get through, sorry about that, but I only share it because I think that some people will genuinely be interested in those things. Change log!

### Artificer 2.0.3

* Added Arcane Retrofit at level 2. Removed all +1 and +2 scaling from weapons (now covered by Arcane Retrofit). Added Arcane Bioengineering feature to Fleshsmith to transfer this property to Natural Weapons.

* Changed ""activate"" to ""use"" in Magical Item Mastery for clarity

* Unburden now works on medium armor as well.

#### Gadgetsmith

* Change ""an attack"" to ""one attack"" in Combat Gadgets. This is codifying the RAI, though I've waffled before on how it was supposed to work. Some instances of multiple spell casting gadgets in one turn proved a bit difficult, so I've gone ahead and clarified it wasn't the intention to allow that; it's more like Gadget War Magic (though stronger as it doesn't take your bonus action).

* Bee Swarm Rockets made 1-10 as an action; multiple rockets are clarified to only trigger 1 saving throw. Damage increased to 2d6 + 1 per rocket.

#### Infusionsmith

* Wording on magic wand clarified.

* You can use Extra Attack (or any additional attacks, such as via haste) with animated weapons. Animated Weapons can only attack one target per turn (so if you want to attack two different targets, you need two animated weapons).

#### Potionsmith

* You can no longer consume an infused potion with the same action as Adrenaline Serum.

* Rocketry added to the main document (from Expanded Toolbox).

* The base range of all instant reactions increased from 15 feet to 20 feet.

* Delivery Mechanism increased to 40 feet. Grants proficiency with Instant Reactions as improvised weapons.

* Shaped Charges removed from Expanded Toolbox (overlapped with Delivery Mechanism too much).

* Reactions that only deal damage (Alchemical Fire, Alchemical Acid, and Explosive Reaction) can now be prepared as an improvised weapon that lasts until the end of your turn as a bonus action (allowing them to be used with the attack action).

* Tweaked the wording on drinking Infused Potions to clarify apparent contradiction (a creature can consume the potion as an action, the potionsmith can consume it as a bonus action or administer it to another creature as an action due to their expertise. Additionally, made consuming it as a bonus action instead of an action *optional* to remove awkward bonus action blocking situations (where you'd rather spend your action on it).

#### Thundersmith

* Weapon Improvement tweaked to account for Arcane Retrofit (you can refund the upgrade if you apply a + to attack and damage via Arcane Retrofit).

* Masterwork weapon tweaked to account for Arcane Retrofit (now applies +2 stacking with any bonus gained from Arcane Retrofit, up to +4).

#### Warsmith

* Distributed Force moved down to level 9 and made Brute Force Fighting, now grants your choice of fighting style from Duelist, Great Weapon Fighting, or Two Weapon Fighting.

* Piloted Golem and related upgrades have been moved to the Expanded Toolbox.

* Titan Grip has been renamed Iron Grip and now allows you to wield Large sized weapons as well as wield a 2 handed weapon in 1 hand. It also gives the benefits of Versatile when using a Versatile weapon in one hand. It now requires Iron Muscle. Moved to require 15th level.

* Iron Muscle has been moved to level 11.

* Focal Reflector removed, Force Blast base range set to 60 feet.

* Force Accumulator added.

#### Fleshsmith

* Uncanny Vitality is at the start of your turn if you have >1 hit point, end of turn if you have zero hit points.

* Perfection of Mind can be used any time you restore hit points to a creature, instead of just when using Intelligence (Medicine) checks to restore hit points.

* Mutating Mastery is now one free use of alter self per short rest.

* Adorable Critter can now attack Int Times per *short* or long rest.

* Uncanny Strength moved to level 11.

* Removed Unnatural Weapons (replaced by Arcane Bioengineering).

* Combined Extra Claws, Fangs, Arms, etc into one Upgrade (Fleshcrafted Mutation).

* Combined enhancements for Extra Claws, Fangs, Arms, etc, into on Upgrade (Fleshcrafted Enhancement). Some of them have been nerfed or tweaked.

* Life Merchant now gives you the spell *life transference* as well as the ability to use it 1/short/long rest.

* Life Void now only effects your first hit after casting *life transference*, but deals and restores 3d8 health instead of 1d6.

* Massive Mutation duration increased (now Con + Int rounds instead of Int rounds).

### Frequently Asked Questions:

> *Why does this exist now that the new UA Artificer/Eberron Artificer is different?*

This was originally an update to the old UA Artificer, and when the new UA Artificer went a different direction, it has split off to become it's own thing as that's what people wanted. While I don't hate the new UA Artificer, it's a different beast holding down a different design space, and doesn't quite line up with what Artificers are in the eyes of many players. I left it up to the community if this should be merged or continue on it's own way, and the overwhelming ask was to keep it a separate thing.

> *Why is this nearly 40 pages? Is that necessary?*

Is it necessary? No. Does it make for a fuller experience? Probably. In general, a player will only be using a subsection of this content, something more akin to 4-5 pages. In many ways you can think of the subclasses are more akin to different classes that are bound together by a common root; as 5e design does not really support adding 7 new classes with 1 subclass each.

5e typically does not offer a lot of customization for your class, but there are exceptions - from Battlemasters and their maneuvers to Warlocks and their Invocations - and this expands on those traditions. I feel like if anything is going to have customization, Artificers are probably the place to do it.

> *Is this balanced?*

Every subclass has been playtested by in excess of a dozen people, and the overall class has been played by thousands of people, hundreds of have left thoughts and feedback. I won't make any claim to perfection, but in general I can say that it is balanced, and won't break your game. The design goal for this class was to ensure it was never setting the ""high water mark"" for power. It may out perform various unoptimized builds in terms of dealing damage, but there's always going to be a PHB build that does more damage. Damage is not the only metric of balance and many factors have been considered, but making the Artificer competitive without overwhelming existing options has been a major factor of the design.

> *40 pages of Artificering options.... Is that all?*

Nope, there's also an [**Expanded Toolbox**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mWGy3HXabPNRaGVimZU5GctVVvwQDpCi).

> There's a ton of grammar errors.

That's not a question :(

That said, there are frequently errors, and I do my best to fix what people point out. People from the discord have created a [copy-edit sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sXm14XZPt8cpuuMOoRwtveuaZvuTHGV_q57ktdduT6U/edit#gid=1086610056) to capture the errors, and if it gets added to that sheet, I do go through and fix it, so it's always improving and polishing on the grammar front.

Here's a little idea I had brewing in my noggin for a while. After looking through the existing Living Spells, I thought it'd be fun to create one that would work as an ally to the party, but not as a ""here's some extra damage for you"" kind of deal.

What do you think?

A new little thing. Part of what has taken so long of working on crafting is that crafting is a lot more than just making things, it's about figuring out how being a person who can make stuff would be applicable to being an adventurer and how it would be integrated into adventuring.

For Blacksmithing, making new swords and armor is cool, but not something you'll be doing frequently, so I wanted to introduce a system of benefits they could benefit from far more frequently that made sense to integrate into their day to day adventuring. Not a massive benefit, but one tangible enough benefit to meaningful reward skipping a watch to work on them or getting a benefit coming out of down time.

This are intended to be used with my recently posted [Camp Actions](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MK0g94rlPq9A0KprEKC)) (taking the Craft Action) but can be used without that system as that system just formalizes what you can already do during a long rest (take a watch, spend 2 hours doing w/e, etc).

### Design Notions

#### Sharpen Weapon

I like mechanics that roll dice because people like to roll dice. This will be a bit of a mileage may vary as not one every loves rolling dice, but as a generalization people like to roll dice, and will remember a feature that lets them roll dice a lot better than a feature that gives them a static modifier. I call this the *bless* phenomena. What is +1d4 an okay modifier when +2 is generally ill advised? Because rolling dice is fun.

The benefit is relatively small, but is the sort of thing players tend to remember because it saves them from a fate players tend to hate the most - rolling bad. A player may easily forget small details, but when the 1 hits, they'll remember they have a feature that lets them reroll it.

I could interact with GWF; some diminishing returns there, but not too worried about that.

#### Maintain Armor

Temporary hit points are an easy to interact with and self sustaining system. It's a minor boost, but one that usually won't get too out of hand inherently. This is generally less value than maintaining weapons, but is also a somewhat more universally useful feature, as everyone can use some hit points.

That this feature may or may not be worth the cost at low levels is perfectly fine - if you want to get the most out of your day, it'll be worth it here and there to push your advantage.

#### Modify Armor

I think this is generally something most DMs allow by default, but makes sense to include here. Nothing really too fancy, and a big help to small creatures who rarely find armor in the right size :)

#### Modify Weapon

Ah... this one is will be controversial... Points 2 and 3 are pretty straight forward. A greataxe with a reduced damage die becomes a d10 which is just a longsword anyway, and a warhammer reduced by d2 is just a d6, which is inline for a martial light weapon.

Because it's just metal weapons, you cannot do anything funky with nets (which wouldn't really matter anyway, as making a net light wouldn't help as it's not a melee weapon). There's one potential loophole, and that's lances, though I'd say they don't apply as they are not made of metal (a metal lance would be far too heavy to wield). Some DM leeway is what is considered metal and not, use it wisely.

The first point is obviously going to be contentious. I don't think it's that bad though - it only works with non magical weapons, and I think provides some interesting options as the game goes on, but obviously it allows for some builds that are fairly powerful. You can restrict it to 2 hand weapons only if you want.

#### Repair Gear

Like modify, I think this is something most people would allow, after all, that's sort of the default point of taking blacksmithing tools. But it makes sense to include it here.

I’ve decided to post a new homebrew every week in an effort to raise money for the International Medical Corps. Here’s post #8!

The Rogue - Quickster:

*Two soldiers stand guard in the throne room, a massive audience chamber for the court of the Queen. The Sovereign's Scepter sits in its rightful place upon the golden chair. The soldiers' duty is sacred: watch over the royal symbol. The soldiers' punishment for failure is simple: they will lose their heads.*

*A halfling man steps through the throne room entrance, clearly out of place. His eyes flash as he beholds the Scepter. The royal soldiers begin to hail the halfling, but before their words can escape their mouths, the halfling becomes a blurred streak on their vision. The soldiers blink, and the halfling stands exactly where he was, but with the Scepter twirling in his hand. Then, he blurs again and disappears. The soldiers stand, their jaws agape. They give futile chase as they feel a tightness around their necks.*

If you like what you see or if you’re just feeling generous, please consider donating to the International Medical Corps. They’re a global humanitarian organization that both provides direct medical assistance to areas in need and helps those areas develop their own healthcare systems. You can learn more about their mission [here.](https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/what-we-do/) They’re pretty busy right now, so I thought this would be a good way to help them out. If you can donate something, great! If you can’t right now, that’s fine too! Please enjoy the Quickster either way :)

785,gkvyfzo,l5rb6z,"GM Binder link [here](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MR5lMtBos9TcXdnqKLO), previous (2.5) thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/inrvoa/druid_circle_of_the_sun_for_druids_that_celebrate/)!

**Overview**

Animals have the Moon, and Fungi have Spores. With the Circle of the Sun, I wanted to represent the last (and my personal favorite) major kingdom: Plants!

**Goals**

- **Diversity.** This druid should be versatile and each one should feel unique, differing with each adventuring day. 
- **Hardiness.** This druid should have staying power.
- **Plant-based.** This druid should be rewarded for choosing plant-based spells. Buffing staple plant-based spells should feel like a nudge and not a drag.

A Sun druid should be a casting-focused subclass, much like a Land druid. However unlike a Land druid, its focus should be on spell diversity and spell finesse, rather than spell slot recovery and expanded spell lists. Instead of a “wizard-like” druid, this should feel like a “sorcerer-” or “bard-like” druid. Diversity of builds and utility is the crux of the class.

With this subclass, I also tried my hand at pioneering a new way to expend the Wild Shape resource. Instead of a summon or a transformation (like Wildfire and Spore druids, respectively), it would modify the druid's spellcasting.

Bloom is the centerpiece of the subclass. Flowers can carry a lot of meaning--so should your casting! One day, you might pick up hellebore, the winter rose, to freeze your enemies in a Cone of Cold. On another, you can inspire Haste in your allies with a camellia (where tea comes from!). Or carry a dandelion into your final battle, making a Wish to defy fate.

**Changelog**

The feedback with 2.5 was great, and I was so stoked to get such a positive response! As an aside, I love that there are so many fellow Sejic fans out there!

- General language tidying.

- Clarified language of Bloom, ensuring there’s no confusion that the spell isn’t learned or prepared.

- Changed the name of the Thorn Whip feature. Hopefully this change and some of the additional flavor text provide a nice visual ribbon for the feature!

- Clarified language on Thorn Whip so that an attack roll doesn’t need to be made to proc the friendly pull effect.

- Clarified language on Firmly Planted to make its activation optional on a turn where movement isn’t expended.

- Added the benefit of half cover to Benevolent Topiary for appropriately-sized creatures. This hopefully makes the feature's benefits feel more like an active buff to your allies than a passive one. 

**Potential Changes**

- **Bloom.** Bloom is still kind of a controversial feature. If you’d like to see some rationale and discussion on it, please refer to the previous version threads! I’m still trying to perfect a way to ensure the philosophy of Bloom remains in-tact, but the mechanics of Wild Shape make it very difficult. The consumption of two resources (Wild Shape and a spell slot) when activating Bloom is just so clunky still, especially when there isn't an existing mechanical template to build from. The necromancy clause is also still something I’m still thinking about. I've heard arguments on its inclusion or exclusion, curious to see how others feel.
- **Benevolent Topiary.** Half cover too much? Full cover for size small creatures?
- **Witherless.** Hit point regain amount?

786,f0maee2,d5k0ez,"Hello once again [r/UnearthedArcana](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/)  
This is the latest ranger archetype I have been working on, the skiptracer!  
It is meant for urban rangers who love ambushing, tracking, chasing, and intimidating their foes. Instead of protecting society from the outskirts of nature like other rangers, they protect the city from itself.  
The main feature gurilla tactics is meant to make you think outside the box and plan your fights to get the surprise on enemies, while still coming up around once every combat on average.

That ability, as well as inspiration for the archetype is from [u/O-kra](https://www.reddit.com/u/O-kra/)'s stalker archetype that can be found [here](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-Lnn4MSqfEjpOU7dypeL).

787,gge2orv,kgb2z5,"Yeah, but it just makes everything needlessly complex. I'd use Fighting Styles, especially that I don't find these specialties that interesting.

d12 + heavy armor + shield is enough for the baseline, I think. The mechanical flavor of additional health just doesn't fit something as general as a class imo.

Well I don't think there's anything wrong with that. At this point everybody will be using magic weapons anyway, and it will allow the character to access two-handed effects while still wielding a shield. Holding two weapons with one hand seems really really weird.

Honestly, something like resistance to all damage would be fitting. Or some regenerating temporary hit points at least.

Then maybe make two such subclasses. I think there should be an ""offensive"" subclass. It doesn't have to be high-damage, but it should encourage more attacking and give opportunities to do se.

After an extended break, the Death Knight is back. The main class is largely unchanged, but there have been some new additions in the subclasses and runes:

The Order of Ebon Blades has been split into two distinct Orders. The Destroyers represent the power and fear aspects previously present in the Ebon Blades and has an emphasis on strength based combat. The Ebon Blades are now focused on the calm and dexterous side of combat.

The Rune Warden and Fallen Paladin have been merged into this document, and the Rune Warden has also had a few updates.

Some new Runes have been added, and the Destroyers have gotten a few unique ones of their own.

UPDATE (05/11/2020@3:30pm EST) V5.31: After all the feedback I received I decided to hop to it and update the documents. Here are the highlights:

* Added the damage and uses for Necrotic Strike on the class table. (shoutout to u/tmoneys13 for prompting me to find a way to do it without overcrowding the class table)
* Clarified how the hit dice cost for changing spells worked.
* Added some clarification text for the Skilled Rider Variant rules.
* Corrected typo on Break the Gate Savage Technique.
* Swapped the Cripple Savage technique and the Overwhelm Weapon Art as each made more thematic sense with the other subclass.
* Initiate Necromancer now lets your undead use your own proficiency bonus.
* Adept Necromancer now give temp HP equal to your DK level instead of only half your DK level.
* Added clarification text to Rune of the Lightning Mount.

If you liked it, please be aware that I made some small updates to the [gmbinder](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-M9obus75DFzWrMY85sp) file based on the feedback, buffing the capstone a smidge.

It’s Monster Week, so I’m back with my newest undead creation, the Otyugh Ghast. Otyughs are one of my favorite creatures, but they’ve always felt a little underdelivered in 5e. Other aberrations like Beholders, Mind Flayers, and Slaad get so much development, but unless you go back to past editions, Otyughs only get the one creature and lore that says they eat trash and hang out in dungeons. That’s totally cool, but you can’t really use them more than once, you know?

So all this was on my mind when I was reading about Ghasts and Ghouls earlier this week. When I read that Orcus can just make any creature a ghoul, I started thinking. Next thing I knew I had some lore and half a statblock for a creature that ate its way to undeath. Now, I think I can definitely use Otyughs in some new context. Having an Otyugh Ghast lead a horde of undead from its maggoty lair can make for a great little adventure, and I’m so excited about what kind of dungeon I could build around that idea. Refuse and garbage, bodies and decay. Mushrooms! All sorts of grossness.

As always, I’m open to constructive criticism, so please let me know what you think. Also, feel free to grab the pdf from [gmbinder](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MASfDS2TTqU2DDs9ZoF) if you’d like and give me a follow on reddit if this resonates.

Special thanks to all those who helped me on this. First to [u/Yorviing](https://www.reddit.com/u/Yorviing/), whose brew challenge on discord inspired the idea for this. In no particular order, additional thanks to [u/BladeBotEU](https://www.reddit.com/u/BladeBotEU/), [u/RobNocte](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheArenaGuy/), and u/Eiti3 for feedback.

Keep an eye out for me next Friday! I’ll be back in a flash.

805,gjjwdhg,kz17i2,"Hey everyone! The Corsair is my attempt on a concept I haven't seen very often: a character who swaps between ranged and melee! I took heavy inspiration from pirates and other fantasy styled gunslingers. I think I've achieved a good balance by limiting it to light weapons. This is version 1.1. Version 1.0 was posted on my GMBinder a week ago, so if you want early access to my content be sure to follow me there! Let me know your thoughts on this one!

While I have you here, would you be interested in a subreddit/discord/patreon/some other thing for an easy access to my stuff and/or a way to discuss homebrew? Let me know if this is something you like.

As usual, any feedback is appreciated!

The Complete Guide to Sanctum is a project I started a year ago. The project focuses on bringing a new setting sourcebook akin to Eberron and Ravnica, including new lore, new races/subraces, a new class, new subclasses, new feats, new backgrounds, new spells, new creatures: basically a full extension on base 5e. Currently, it is around 40% complete. Large sections of it are mapped out but I still have lots of work to do before I am finished. I'll be sharing content here whenever I can.

Have you ever wanted to have some gift of divine powers from your god without being a cleric? Have you ever wanted your cleric to be even more a divine empowered badass? Well you've come the right place, because we have feats for the holiest among you.

This is based off a patreon request and covers only a moderately slice of the default pantheon based on that - Mystra, Tyr, Sune, Lathander, Helm, Ilmater, and Selune. These can be repurposed to a pretty with slate of gods as that covers a pretty broad range of gods in domain, purpose, and style, but I also plan to expand this in time if there's interesting.

These are somewhat powerful feats, but I generally feel that feats have to be fairly powerful to be a real consideration, and they generally have the natural limitation that you can only take one based on which god you follow, so there's not too much danger of mixing and matching these (though a DM could allow it if they wanted).

#### Changelog

* ...nothing yet!

#### Design Notes and Anticipated Questions:

> You use Proficiency bonus. I hate that.

Okay.

> These feats scale. Feats shouldn't scale.

Okay.

...in all seriousness both are things that people can have valid concerns over, are generally going to have to fall into a difference of opinion. WotC has moved toward using Proficiency bonus for many things, and I've decided to follow suit, particularly when it comes to class independent things. You can convert it back to your attribute of choice if you really want. As for scaling feats, I generally disagree that feats don't scale, but have this argument enough to suspect someone will complain about it, but ultimately I want feats that are good throughout the game, and the vast majority of feats that are good through the game effectively scale, even if they don't explicitly scale (GWM/SS scales with # of attacks, PAM/CBE scale with your weapon and stats, Magic Initiate Cantrips scale, etc). I get the difference between this sort of scaling and that, but this is a design I feel works for what I'm looking to do; a feat without scaling tends to just end up as somewhere between ""variant human bait"" if it's too strong at level 1, or useless if it's too weak at level 8/12 when others can start to get it.

> The God I want is missing!

Let me know what it is and I'll see if I can include it in a future update if we keep going with this.

> Why are some half feats and other full feats?

It really just depended on what felt like a good fit for that god and theme. More martial oriented ones tend to more likely to be a half feat.

Let me know any thoughts or feedback! These were a patreon request and are already being tested out by the requestor - I added in a few extras based on some that perhaps my players could use in the future as well, but I look forward to seeing what people do from them, and perhaps expanding the system if people like the idea and want to see more gods.

I’ve decided to post a new homebrew every week in an effort to raise money for the International Medical Corps. Here’s post #13!

Race - The Barri:

*Captain Jissik rubbed her temples as she looked at the haul for the day. Piled, or perhaps a better term would be scattered, on the deck of the ship was a pathetic gathering of fish, maybe a hundred the size of her palm. It had been four days of this, and her crew was dangerously behind their quotas. Captain Jissik moved to the side of her ship, the ship that she had spent the past five years of her life running, and the previous twenty years of her life earning, and Jissik sighed. Then, she saw a shape pass by in the water, something big.*

*Jissik shouted at her crew to give chase, and soon they were on its tail. A line of three Barri held spears in their hands, attached to the boat with strong rope and elaborate knots. One of her crew threw his spear and missed. Another landed, but did not stick. Then, Jissik saw her opportunity and pierced the shape, a burst of blood darkening the cold water. The crew felt the boat surge forward as it bended to the will of their catch, but Jissik would not lose control of her ship to a beast. She leaped into the water below, and wrestled the monster in a great splashing of blood and ice. Then, the water went still, and the Captain emerged from the water, her arm wrapped around the neck of the beast. The crew cheered as they beheld the size of their catch, and Jissik allowed herself a moment of deep satisfaction.*

They’re a global humanitarian organization that both provides direct medical assistance to areas in need and helps those areas develop their own healthcare systems. You can learn more about their mission [here.](https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/what-we-do/) They’re pretty busy right now, so I thought this would be a good way to help them out. If you can donate something, great! If you can’t right now, that’s fine too! Please enjoy the Barri either way :)

In a sense, I sort of made this like what a monkbarian would be like, but with a flavor that makes more sense for a barbarian to have; after all, Venom and other similar monsters tend to be very brutish, monstrous, and muscular, so it only made sense to make it a barbarian compared to a monk.

EDIT: The two links above are now updated and show the newest version (v1.2). There have been no changes in mechanics, only some changed wording to make features and especially the spells more clear. I've summarised the changes below.

Change Log v1.1 -> v1.2:

- Slightly changed the wording in the second paragraph of Amplified Blade to clarify the power of the amplification from Weave Shroud.

- Changed the wording for *arcing bonds* to make it more clear how the spell is supposed to work. 

 - It's intended that every target has their own separate bond with the caster, and only their own bond is broken by moving away. Also clarified that the caster should not take damage from their own spell.

- Improved the wording on the *chaotic storm* note that explains how I suggest rolling for the spell to keep it as simple and efficient as possible.

Change Log v1.0 -> v1.1:

- Combat Clarity now only works with the spectral blade. I don't think a Rogue/Knight-Enchanter MC was too strong before, but I still made this restriction just to be on the safe side. 

- Weave Shroud now increases speed by 10 feet for every spell level after 1st. This to make using a 1st level slot a bit weaker, while making the use of 3rd-5th level spell slots feel like less of a waste.

- Some small wording improvements here and there.

- Added 3 new spells! *Echoing blade*, *arcing bonds* and *energy barrage* are spells aimed to be useful for arcane casters that find themselves in melee.

#Designer's Notes

**Echoing Blade**

During my initial creation of the Knight-Enchanter, I balanced the subclass around the existence of the SCAG cantrips; *booming blade* and *green-flame blade*. However, a commenter rightly pointed out that people may not be aware of or have access to these cantrips. I didn't want to give them out as part of the subclass, but I did want to make sure a Knight-Enchanter would be very likely to pick up a similar cantrip to make sure they are as effective as they're supposed to be. Therefore I opted to create my own spell and add it to the document to ensure every Knight-Enchanter is at least aware of a suitable cantrip for the subclass.

*Echoing blade* is very similar to *booming blade* and has identical damage, but where *booming blade* deals damage upon willing movement, this spell allows the target to use their reaction to avoid the damage instead. It works out very similar where a target needs to choose between taking damage or limiting their options. I really like the flavour of a second arcane version of the weapon striking at the target, but I also imagine players can switch this up a little bit if they choose. For example, one player could decide that the arcane echo is a conjured weapon being swung by their other hand instead. All in all, I'm quite happy with this cantrip.

**Arcing Bonds**

This spell shares flavour with *witch bolt*, though hopefully feels more satisfying and useful. It synergises perfectly with gishes that are in melee, as the spell has short range and effectively forces target to move away from them and possibly provoke an opportunity attack. Alternatively they could try to break the caster's concentration and avoid the damage entirely.

The damage of this spell is a bit higher than similar spells (*flaming sphere*/*moonbeam*) because of a couple of reasons:

- The short range and it being centred on the caster.

- The target limit (three).

- Possibility of avoiding all damage by breaking concentration early.

- The spell no longer doing damage after targets have moved out of range, whereas other spells can be moved back into targets and damage them again.

**Energy Barrage**

This is a spell that is based on the spell of the same name from Dragon Age: Inquisition. I really loved the visuals and mechanics of the spell and really wanted to translate it to 5e. In the game, the spell has two options and I therefore wanted to do the same for the spell I created here.

The *controlled bombardment* option turns the spell into one similar to *scorching ray* and allows you to choose to deal either fire, cold or lightning damage as you shoot controlled blasts of energy at nearby targets. *Chaotic storm* turns the spell into a volatile and random AoE similar to *fireball*. Because the blasts are so random, there aren't any saving throws.  It's really just luck that determines how badly you get hit. The expected damage is still similar to *fireball* though, even though the distribution is vastly different. The damage type is also no longer under the caster's control and may differ for each target.

While I'm aware that this spell is essentially two spells at the cost of one, I think this is acceptable because it lacks versatility elsewhere. The big limiting factor is range and area of effect, which is a lot worse than similar spells. I also like the fact that the spell is most suited for melee casters and gishes, which can have a limited amount of spells known (e.g. Eldritch Knight). Because I think the above points balance each other out, I've left the expected damage of both options comparable to other similar spells.",UnearthedArcana,"Knight-Enchanter v1.1 | An alternative to the Bladesinger, now with custom spells for casters in melee!",Subclass

Ever wanted to play that one old guy? The one in westerns, anime, and fantasy stories that shows up with a bunch of odd trinkets and personality quirks and gives the heroes the push they need? Here you go! Even more infusions to fill your pockets with Pipes and Wands of all kinds, this is a support class in its purest form. Most of your abilities dont even work on you!

Would love thoughts on the balance of this, support is SO much harder to balance then damage

Another version of the Psion, this time we get a new subclass specializing in bringing imagination to life, mastering the Discipline of Projection, and we with a new more destructive option for igniting, freezing, or shocking the world with Psychokinetics.

Joining the roster is the Psychic Warrior for the Fighter with some integration options to overall Psion through Feats and the Way of the Soulknife returns with some revamping, expanding the energy blade capabilities!

## Change Log v1.2

* Talent progression changed. It now starts at 2, and has a different growth to better fill dead levels.
* Shaper added, a subclass powers that enhance projection.
* Removed Quick Command from Astral Construct
* Psychokinetics Discipline added, a discipline that manipulates raw energy.
* Elemental Weapon talent added.
* Elemental Aegis talent added.
* Projected Nightmare talent added.
* Psi Crystal Talent expanded.
* Added the requirement of Sight to all the Psionic Powers; people were coming up with too many broken combos. Added Unseeing Sight to remove it. This way it takes at least some investment. Note that you still need a way to know where they are (they cannot be hidden from you).
* Telekinetic Force made a Strength Saving throw.
* Removed the stun chance from the Psychokinetics lightning. Made the arc default power and buff the arc with the specialization like with fire.
* Revamped Soul Knife
* Added Psychic Warrior
* Alternate Effect Spell Lists have been reduced.

My goal was to emulate other full casters with a frontline subclass, specifically the College of Swords, War Domain, and Bladesinging. The goal is not to have a gish that outshines martial classes, but rather a sorcerer that fulfills its role from the front lines, similar to how the Bladesinger is still—at the end of the day—a wizard and not a fighter.

So this is my second attempt at the Tideborn, which was originally part of the Birth Aquatica post I made a few weeks. Moving forward I’m still really enamoured by choosing a core element (e.g water/fire/earth/air) and messing around with a couple of niche concepts within that specific “genre” if you will.  
At its core, the Tideborn is a controller, rewarded for pushing and pulling enemies here, there and everywhere. If that floats your boat and you give it a try at home I’d love to hear of any shenanigans you get up to!

I've been working on this bad boy for more than a year, and it's finally done! This is a collection of new and revised subclasses themed around martial combat. 

**Subclasses**—revises several martial archetypes that I thought needed some work or fell behind, including the *battlerager*, *path of the storm herald,* *purple dragon knight*, *champion,* and adds a *ton* of new ones. Rogues with wind at their heels, fighters who dance with blazing flames, druids who not only eschew the taboo on steel armor but embrace its use, fighters who choose a single target and hunt them down without mercy. And much more! 

**Items**—based on my work on my old account for *[Weapons Remastered, Revised](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/928ue7/weapons_remastered_revised_a_comprehensive/)* that expands weapons just a bit further to give each weapon a unique combination of properties and powers to diversify combat. It also includes new crafting rules and a slew of poisons, bombs, oils, and more, both from me and from all over the brew community (credits on page 69). Nothing is copied wholesale, and for everybody I could get ahold of, material is edited/included with permission. 

**Rules**—the sets of house rules and tweaks to class features I added in my homes games that I feel worth sharing. They include changes to *hex* and *hunter's mark* to prevent spell tax, changes to weapon drawing rules (you draw a weapon as part of the attack you make) to make thrown weapons and weapon-switching viable, and much more!

840,fuow0ok,h84yd6,"Hello r/UnearthedArcana, this is my first time posting on this subreddit. Currently, this is a subclass that I've been working on with a couple folk on a homebrew discord server for a friend who wants to play a gun-wielding wizard that does spell morphing. While flavouring the Eldritch Knight would be more viable, I thought about the idea of playing a gish type ranged wizard.

Link to [Homebrewery](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/DRo0wfR4o).

The idea of this subclass is that it's somewhat similar to the mages of The Saga of Tanya the Evil. While not tied to any religious ideas or anything, I was more fascinated with the magic the mages used and found it interesting to see wizards using rifles as spellcasting foci. An artillerist of this type would morph spells in the middle of battle, attempt to daze targets, and launch devasating magic attacks all over the battlefield. Please give me your thoughts, criticisms, and concerns over this subclass. Thank you.",UnearthedArcana,School of Arcane Artillery: A gish type firearm wielding wizard that morphs spells within the battlefield [5e],Subclass
841,ego41ix,ark640,"Wow this got a bunch of attention. Gonna hijack your comment u/JaiTuKan to respond to some concerns.

First off, my thoughts on the *Flurry Strikes* feature. When I was making this I also thought it'd be powerful to get an infinite number of Slows per day but once I looked into it I kinda realized that any spell casting class can do it wayyyyy more than the monk (probably) ever will with it being AOE and the fast rate they gain spell slots. My idea was that the difficulty of hitting both flurry of blows would replace the ""difficulty"" of the enemy getting to make the save. As for the number of times it can be used concern, you have to remember that it still costs a ki point and doing this 6 times a day when you unlock it would mean using your ki points for nothing else. I do think that adding the initial save back in is definitely on the table and seeing as it seems like the most complained about ability so far( u/seb_veteran-sleeper and u/terrik74 mentioned it as well) that'll probably be the first change i make.

As for *Deep Freeze,* u/suchredditmuchmeme and the thread he started brought up how spammable it was and I agree. I think it's pretty clear that I took inspiration form the sun soul and kinda just themed it to this class which is why the base use is free of charge. Taking into account u/enraric's comment about the temp hp too I think I might take the temp hp out of the base usage so that it doesn't do AS much for free, I do however like the idea of getting a less effective version without spending ki. As for only targeting hostile hostile creatures u/seb_veteran-sleeper, I should probably take that out but it really makes the ability feel weak because you can't quite position it like say a Fireball since it originates from you. After the changes I'm thinking of it would probably look something like

>Each creature in a 15 foot cube originating from you must make a Dexterity saving throw vs your Ki save DC or take 2d6 cold damage. Additionally, the area becomes difficult terrain until the start of your next turn.  
>  
>You can increase the effect of this feature by spending ki points. When you spend ki points this way the cube grows to 25 feet and you may choose to coat yourself in a protective layer of ice to gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier as part of the action. For each point you spend, to a maximum of 3, the cold damage and the temporary hit points both increase by 1d6.

Onto *Enduring Defense*, the bane of my existence. So this capstone ability took forever for me to come up with, I wanted temp hp in there somewhere and I also liked the idea of regaining ki points in some hard to achieve scenario so my initial version of this ability just had you parrying attacks on yourself. My concern with this was that it would never go off. I mean, if you get attacked 20 times in one combat the expected result is one crit. So I went through a bunch of other capstones but eventually came back and just made it more common, which kinda worked for me. But, as u/yousei11 and u/karatous1234 mentioned I'm still concerned it won't happen enough for a capstone. As it is now it's an ability that when it goes off, it GOES OFF, but other than then your just sitting and waiting. I feel like it doesn't deserve a limit or MAYBE a limit per short rest (I'd most likely choose WIS mod) because you can go through whole combats without it even happening then when you finally get a good streak having it get cut off by a limit, while unlikely, would feel pretty shitty.

Feel free to let me know what everyone thinks of these changes!

Warlock pacts are one of those things that it's hard to have too many, given that there's so many powerful tempting free rides of power out there to make pacts with! It's a crowded market though with the Storm Sorcerers and Storm Clerics and whatnot, but that left this one free to specialize a bit on things that'd make it feel good to play as a Warlock.

The eternal toil of a Warlock is their very limited spell slots, so I was looking for a way to attach some ways of extending the power of those limited pact magic slots, as well as give meaningful progression to staying in the class, while keeping it an interesting multiclass (as Warlocks so traditionally are).

The full list of Artificer Spells can be found in the  [**The Expanded Toolbox**](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LR85y6FKnWhRAWIJgSP); Artificer Spells included in the main document are already existing Artificer Upgrades that were tranistioned to use spells. Some of these spells are adaptions of 3.5 Artificer Spells or even 4e Artificer spells (both being updated and incorporated into over all 5e methodology), and some of them are brand new.

# 1.6.1 Revised Artificer Changes

* Changed the wording on Skilled Animation to just reflect the fighting styles and made it more clear what weapon types they apply to (as they do not follow the rest of the restrictions).

* Changed Animated Weapons to count as wielded with 2 hands - meaning 1 handed weapons with the versatile property can apply the d10 damage, as this balances more closely to 2 handed weapons.

* Thunder Mine upgrade now casts the Thunderburst Mine spell.

* Explosive Mine upgrade now casts the Fireburst Mine spell.

* Dispel Magic added to the Artificer Spell list.

## Infusionsmith

* Infuse Weapon added as a variant feature, rather than an upgrade from Expanded Toolbox. This model fits better as it makes it a less awkward transition for Infusionsmiths that want to take this path from level 1, and requires less inherent powerbudget. This is sort of a compromise between the new version and the old version that should make everyone happy :) . Infusionsmith has always been the subclass that harkens back to the more classic versions of Artificer, so I really wanted to ensure it can be played very similar to that, Infusing their weapon and making attacks if they want. A lot of people seem to be using it as a Gish build as well, and I feel that's a pretty good use, so I've endeavored to ensure it fits as many playstyles as possible as smoothly as possible.

* Changed Quick Infusions to Quick Enchantments... to many things are called Infusions.

* Infuse Weapon upgrade changed to Empower Weapon (to avoid naming confusion). Can expend a 1st level spell slot to increase the damage of the Empowered attack.

* Spinning Blades moved to the Expanded Toolbox.

## Warsmith

* Adaptable Armor removed and moved to the Expanded Toolbox for further development.

* Energy Surge no longer takes a bonus action, but has limited uses.

* Force Blast now scales like the rest of the Artificer weapons (+1 @ 5, +2 @ 14).

* Flight Upgrade is now Incompatible with Piloted Golem.

### Expand Toolbox 1.2 Changes

* Added Apothecary Background.

* Removed Disruption Projector

* Edited Enchant Weapon

* Added Artificer Spells

#### Gadgetsmith

* Smoky Images upgrade added.

* Vanishing Trick no longer requires a spell slot, but is now 1/short or long rest rest.

#### Infusionsmith

* Enchanted Weapon has been moved to the main document and renamed Infused Weapon, and converted into a Variant 1st level feature; this is because it operates more gracefully as 1st level feature, not requiring an upgrade or change to play style at level 3.

#### Warsmith

* Modified Ether Reactor to apply to Artificer upgrades that cast spells. Ether Reactor removes the limited usage of Energy Surge.

* Thunder Fist changed to Thunder Channel, no longer requires Powerfist upgrade, but does require 9th level Artificer.

* Self Repair Matrix changed to Proficiency modifier (instead of 1/4 Artificer level); effectively this is +1 hp, and much easier to calculate/reference.

* Added Defensive Structuring Upgrade

#### Fleshsmith

* Added new Principle Improvement - Extra Fangs

* Added some Upgrades for Extra Fangs - Dark Pact, Consumptive Hunger, Iron Jaw.

854,eheqi5d,adbpdg,"> Do the bleaded armor feature and the fleshsmith bite feature add strength to damage?? It would be odd for a physical attack to not have an added modifier, especially when said attacks are intended to be used as a main source of damage.

The bladed body is a rider, it does not add any modifiers. The Strength would be added to the attack as normal, the 1d4 is just a rider effect it can use it's bonus action to deliver. As there is no attack involved in the grapple check, that would also not add Strength, it's just a rider. For Bladed Body though, it's essentially still just free damage in both cases, as grapple normally does no damage, and a Golem doesn't usually use their bonus action in most cases.

The question about Fleshsmith's Bite makes me think you're probably on the older version of the Expanded Toolbox, so I will note there is the latest version [here](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LR85y6FKnWhRAWIJgSP); this probably hasn't been pushed to the PDF version yet. The bite line of upgrades was axed as it was ultimately just too much thematic drift (they were unavoidably basically just making a vampire). That said, it would add Strength as it was either a natural weapon or an unarmed strike (I don't remember which off the top of my head) both of which add Strength damage.

If you are referring specifically to Iron Jaw (I think it was called) it would note, as that's just a rider to Grapple, there is no attack involved. That feature has been renamed Iron Grip and applies too all Grapples now.

Grapples would never be the main source of damage - you Grapple someone and than you continue to attack them if you want to do damage. Grappling is just to inflict the condition to prevent them from running away. One might find it curious that Grappling with fangs does not do damage inherently, but here we are, that's just the rules. Adding a little bit of damage to grappling with fangs or spiked bodies was the intention here, but adding strength to a rider would be a bit extreme. If something does not call itself an attack, typically it does not add a modifier unless it says it does.

Creating a subclass helps you understand what the base class is about, and you can use it as a practice of implementing different ways to empower a class.

One trick up my sleeves: When I'm stuck, I go for a subclass where it is just a ripoff of another class. From [my old homebrew](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-L5zr_jHuQ3elTQ9e2W3): Path of the Scourge is a barbarian subclass that is really half a warlock and half a paladin, and Faith Militant is fighter pretending to be a cleric.",DnDHomebrew,Apex Ranger (Homebrew ranger class),5e Workshop
866,dixiky7,6gyhs4,"> Ok, so you want to remove Dex from combat damage and now you're not sure how to flavour bows or crossbows for Str attack rolls.

The question was more along the lines of if I should do that or go about it differently. Not really needing help with how to flavor it, though you did a great job. 

> Removing Dex from combat and replacing it with strength is only going to hinder Dex based classes, because they will need to put points intostr just to keep up with damage.

Well here is the thing, assuming point-buy, a rogue can easily start with 14 Strength and 16 Dex. I implemented another house rule that means two-weapon fighting gets half modifier to bonus action attack. So at level 1 with these stats the total damage output will be the same as RAW and at higher levels with 20 Dex the rogue will be doing 2 less damage than normal but already deal 6d6 (4d6 sneak + 1d6 shortsword + 1d6 bonus action) so the damage difference isn't really noticeable. 

The monk gets higher martial arts die, meaning the monk gets the very interesting choice of having awful AC but great damage (Strength) or normal damage and normal AC as RAW (Dex). 

As for ranged characters, that is where the problem lies... 

Also, I gave light armor users access to chain shirt (with whole dex modifier, not just max 2) and access to a buckler that works exactly like a shield but with only +1 to AC instead. Rogues can also deal sneak damage with any weapon now. 

> My guess is that none of you have played it with Dex for damage, my suggestion would be to maybe play a couple of one shots with Dex for attack and damage on ranged and finesse weapons and see how it works for you guys, you might find it isn't as bad as it sounds.

We have tried it, and didn't like it at all (most of us at least). I do think Dex is a god stat, but I must remind you that everything isn't about numbers. The rogue could just have gotten more sneak damage and the monk (like I did) could get better martial arts die. 

Once again, even though I think Dex is too good, this isn't about the end result. Imagine you pick up 6e or a new supplement to 5e that included weapons with the property *brutish*. *Brutish* weapons lets you make attack and damage rolls with your constitution modifier. Wouldn't that be something you really disliked? And wouldn't you become very frustrated when people say the game was made with that weapon in mind so you cannot change it? 

Well *finesse* weapons are about as silly to me as *brutish.* Not necessarily because finesse cannot be explained to make sense but because so many other things can be explained to make sense. Like fighting with charisma because you have learned to naturally taunt your enemy and feint. 

So once again, this isn't about the end result. That is why I am thinking of giving ranged weapons access to strength so a fighter for instance would have the same damage. This has almost entirely to do with the fact that using dex for damage feels wrong. 

I know there is a lot, but that is because once you change something you easily get follow-up problems. If you want to see, [here](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/Hy8yg3pgW) are all the house rules currently. ",DnDHomebrew,[5e] I removed dex to damage but need some advice,5e Workshop
867,g35crjc,ii9qrc,"To me, neither Crossbow Expert nor Sharpshooter have ever really lived up to their names, so this is an attempt to rectify that and I wanted to get some feedback on them; I don't *think* they're overpowered, but I could have easily missed something.

# Crossbow Expert

The first thing you'll likely notice is that the bullet point about ignoring the Loading property is gone. Why? Because crossbows don't work that way unless they're explicitly magic; being an expert doesn't allow you to ignore fundamental physical properties like that.

The second, potentially, is that the bullet point about being within 5ft of an enemy now applies *only* to crossbows. It didn't make sense to me for a *Crossbow* Expert to make traditional bows even better; it's an entirely different skill set that doesn't really translate. 

The addition of being prone not inflicting disadvantage on crossbows was inspired by a bullet point from [this Roguish subclass](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/adzsok/subclass_roguish_archetype_deadeye/) that I thought made a ton of sense; being prone is supposed to impose disadvantage because your arms just don't bend that way, so attacking with most weapons is difficult. A loaded crossbow, however, only requires the user to, effectively, point and click.

The first two bullet points were taken from [Crossbow Expert revision](https://www.enworld.org/threads/crossbow-expert-redux.584750/), as I felt they also made sense, to a degree; you're well trained with a crossbow, so you're more accurate, and with heavy crossbows, that translates to more lethal shots.

The bonus action attack with a hand crossbow is largely unchanged, though you can load it as part of the same bonus action; another thing that made sense to me, as hand crossbows in reality have significantly weaker draw weights than full sized crossbows. The historical examples of pistol crossbows were generally meant for very close ranges, such as indoor target shooting. Wouldn't do to have something powerful enough to punch through the wall, now would it?

# Sharpshooter

The biggest change here is the final bullet point, so I'll address it first. Sharpshooter's biggest draw is the -5/+10, same as on Great Weapon Master; on GWM, it makes perfect sense (though I prefer revisions where the -/+ is based on proficiency), because instead of a nice, controlled cut that has a great deal of accuracy, you're delivering a wild baseball swing that is *insanely* telegraphed, but hits like a truck if it actually connects. 

On Sharpshooter, however, that makes no bloody sense and is entirely contrary to what a sharpshooter *is*. No marksman worth the name is going to trade accuracy for power when it might mean they'll miss their shot. Instead, I was once more inspired by the aforementioned Roguish subclass and used the subclass' Take Aim feature as inspiration. The goal is a patient marksman who steadies their aim for a surer kill.

As for the other bullet points, the height-based cover negation is from [entrench's Martial Mastery](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LOsP482aPjUpFqiiUu-) version of Sharpshooter and was, again, something that made sense. Being a good marksman doesn't mean you can ignore fundamental principles like that.

The short range increase made sense to me in that a truly skilled archer will know exactly when their shot will start falling off and so will be able to instinctively compensate for it, giving them greater accuracy at further ranges.",DnDHomebrew,Crossbow Expert & Sharpshooter | Trying to bring these feats more in line with their names,5e
868,ejvsxg0,b83xft,"Not going to talk about balance, as I suck when it comes to balancing spell casters. However there are some major problems that I can give you a hand with!

&#x200B;

I'd advise you to take a look at other patrons and remodel your project following the usual template. The template for what a patron gives you is usually:

* Extended Spell List: 2 spells per spell level (from first to fifth level).
* Bonuses associated with it's patron at levels: 1, 6, 10, and 14

Other points are:

**Prayers:**

* The Lord's prayer: Giving +3 movement speed is not a terminnology used in 5e. Replace it with 15ft to make it fitting. If your original goal was to add 3ft movement (why?), increase it to 5ft. There is no such a thing as 3ft anything in 5e.
* Glory to the Father: Boosting a target's AC is always useful, but there are two problems here. The first one is that Warlocks are usually low on the AC aspect, so this is not that great of an ability and I'd probably change it to a +2 to AC or something like that. The second is the 15 second rule. Either make it 12 or 18. In 5e, a round is 6 seconds, try to work with it.
* The Ave Maria: No. Seriously. No doubling roll values. Specially not at 50% chance. Halving a failed roll won't change anything, doubling it probably will make it a success. Aside from that, you will be adding a lot of extra rolls, as players will just use it on every single roll.

While writing it up, my ideas changed, and I ended up with a ""holy"" spell that can only be cast by Good aligned creatures. The obvious follow-up was to make a dark version of it, for the Evil aligned creatures and players out there. The spell components reflect that, and since angel feathers aren't exactly easy to come by I opted to allow for any kind of white or black feathers respectively while adding a religious symbol to compensate for the lack of angel feathers.

I suppose, in theory a spell caster could use angel feathers to replace all the components, but that's up to the DM in the end. But I don't see why they would use something so valuable for a 5th level spell when they have an alternative.

* I understand that artificer's bread and butter is supposed to be magic item, but I thought that was something very 3.5rd, not exactly 5th.

From what I see, artificer should exist with ""Creating Magic Item"" rules.
* Even then, the free magic item part somewhat bugged me. From what I see, not all items of the same rarity are valued the same. Even with the list, the choice seemed slightly skewed. So I thought, maybe artificer can make magic items faster and cheaper, but not downright free and instantly.
* The spell list was pretty much okay with me, and I'm not exactly against third-level spell slot progression, but overall, the class seemed somewhat incomplete even with magic items and subclass gimmicks. I mean, if the spells are all supposed to be support-oriented, why not half-level progression?

I had a few things in mind as I designed the archetype: **OVERWHELMING AND BRUTE STRENGTH**, the Warrior class from WoW (see the Brutality Points mechanic), and /u/MatthewMercer's [Gunslinger Class](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjasbe554LOAhVLHGMKHcpRDmwQFggcMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dmsguild.com%2Fproduct%2F170778%2FGunslinger-Martial-Archetype-for-Fighters&usg=AFQjCNHG1cd1-to2ISOpTi4W-yQ0NE0XhA&sig2=r1BzKuNMnW4oZwN8DLYs1g&bvm=bv.127521224,d.cGc). So hopefully that gives you some sense of the flavor I'm going for.

I am well aware that this archetype is probably horribly imbalanced (that's where I'm hoping you'll all come in), and it is as yet un-playtested. Further, the level 14 feature, Annihilating Strikes, is sort of a placeholder at the moment.

884,gc74wnk,jtns76,"I'm always looking for more weapons.  Let's see what you've got here.

So we're going to consider increased crit range and ""brutal"" critical as positive properties.  I would think about actually making those properties as that cleans this up and you can define how that works with anything else that increases the crit range.

Personally I don't like confirming critical.  I think it takes away from the highs of rolling a crit and slows down game play.  Because of that I'm going to ignore that column as suggested.

Bonus would be highlighting changes.  ;)

### Simple Melee

* Unarmed ~ I'm mixed on forcing unarmed to be nonlethal.  Does critical x2 do anything here?  

* Dagger, Punching & Gauntlet, Spiked ~ Depending if you're thinking katar or punch dagger, I'd think about advantage or immunity against disarms.

* Sickle ~ I need to see people play with a sickle more.  I'd be quicker to play with disarm as the feet feel far to me on a hand sickle (not a scythe).

* Club ~ Doesn't that eclipse the Light Mace?  I feel your pain as I really wish for about one more level of dice when I think of simple weapons.  Why isn't this in the Light Melee Weapons?

* Heavy Mace ~ Curious.  Before heavy didn't appear in the simple weapons or without the two-handed property.  I'm not sure how I feel about that change here.

* Shortspear ~ Why not in the Light weapons?

* Greatclub ~ That addition works out, though I might split that up.

* Quarterstaff ~ That looks like a powerful upgrade if you're adding a BA attack.  Where are your extra properties written up?

* Spear ~ Why not versatile?  Is it really worth the extra write up?

* Javelin ~ So you can't use this with strength?  or as a melee weapon?

* Composite Shortbow ~ if this was Finesse I could see including it, or super expensive...but I'm not sure why the added complexity is really worth it.  Remember ranges are always simple fractions. 1:2, 1:3, 1:4...3:8 doesn't count.  If you really did research about distances for direct and indirect fire you might convince me otherwise.  *Maybe*, as realism is often sacrificed on the altar of simplicity.

* Kukri ~ if a handaxe is light, I guess this can be too.  Though I would have expected it to be one rank higher.  Ah, you're basing this on the crit range...which is optional...if I run into that too many more times I might stop as I feel that I won't really be helping.

* Spiked Armor ~ I'm curios if this is going to be a punch or more like grappling.  If it's a punch, shouldn't it be like a spiked gauntlet?

* Shortsword is in the ""Light"" section...but isn't light?  I'm so confused.

* Flail is certainly the winner here over the battleaxe or the warhammer and often even against the longsword, and the scimitar is better than the rapier.

Welcoming all balance concerns, critique, etc. I decided that I wanted to make some ranger subclasses that focused more on the unique pet that they tame. I created stat blocks based on existing monsters, but tried to leave them open to reflavoring (ie, if you wanted a flying dinosaur instead of a bird, or a bear mount instead of a horse). The format is based on XGE's format of Ranger archetypes.

Any feedback is very appreciated!

If this is popular or well received I may expand the compendium to include other popular ranger companions (panthers/big cats, snakes, bears, boars, etc). Let me know if you'd be interested!

Also, I noticed that the mount companion's passive perception was wrong. I changed it in GMBinder but the image still shows 10. You don't need to mention it :D",DnDHomebrew,"How to Train Your...: 3 Beast Master Ranger Archetypes (v1, looking for feedback)",
889,er6gp3u,bpg22u,"So, its been 25 goddamn days since i last posted...

Apearantly the 'wraithblade' needed a lot of reworking but i eventually got there.

&#x200B;

What i changed:

**Main Class**

* Blade wielder no longer has: 'turn damage into necrotic damage when you kill an enemy'. (it felt clunky and a bit boring. Sadly the wraithblade does lose a small necrotic touch.)
* Blade wielder no longer has: add WIS, this was so op. (i didn't want to go the hexblade route where you have to choose between STR or WIS and thought, just add a bit of WIS.)
* Bladcrafts... i'll get to this later...
* Fighting Style, removed archery (unnecessary)
* Reverence, cleared up certain mistakes and things i forgot to mention.
* Extra Attack, only one xtra attack (you already get the bonus attack from blade wielder, to op if both).
* Wraith's Protection, made it so you have to trigger it, uses bonus action so you have to choose between another attack and wraith's protection.
* *added* Unparalleled Wielder, this one i'm not sure about...

**Subclasses...**

* *added* **Craft of the Warrior,** based on the previous *craft of the heirloom* but more streamlined and focused.
* *added* **Craft of the Heirloom,** based on the previous *craft of magic* but with a better magic system, inspired by both druid: circle of the land and barbarian: totem warrion (hope this one isn't too confusing)
* **Craft of the Cold Night,** generally stayed the same

&#x200B;

So, i think that the 1st draft was pure shit, this one however feels better and honestly pretty cool, a few of my thoughts however:

* The craft of the Heirloom ahas a few lineages that could probably work as a seperate subclass (the lineage of blood/flowers to be exact) what do you think about that.
* flavor text still sucks (except the flavor texr for *craft of the warrior*, that's some dope flavor text...)

&#x200B;

p.s. i was originally going to just post this draft on the subreddit but i thought i'd check here first, i know sounds very mellow... but i do appreciate the feedback.

891,eebmmqm,ah0g0c,"Hallo there! Let's see what we have here:

I recommend using [Homebrewery](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com) or [GM Binder](https://www.gmbinder.com) for formatting and templates.

**Crazy, Not Stupid.** I agree with the one-third of the subclass, because barbarian tend to neglect Intelligence and the bonus would not be game-breakingly high. I would add ""(a minimum of +1)"" just to be safe, though.

I can't agree with Unarmored Defense part, because it kinda topples how Armor Class is supposed to work. To quip, Bladesinger wizard may *add* Intelligence to Armor Class during the bladesong, but never *replace* Intelligence with Dexterity. This adds up bookkeeping.

Casting one of the strongest 1st-level mezzer is one thing, and casting it *only* while raging is another. The reason barbarian can't cast spell while raging is, apart from the thematic reason, becauses of the sheer bonus of the rage is so much that casting a spell or even concentrating on one can be easily overpowered.

If you're casting a spell, what is the save DC for your spell?

**Raging Insanity.** Is deliberately and blatantly more powerful than Berserker subclass' Mindless Rage (same level).

**Infectious Laughter.** Casting a spell was enough, and you're adding what is even more powerful version of sorcerer's Twinned Spell *and* Heightened Spell Metamagic options on top of it.

**More Personal.** A typical D&D game would *not* have a firearm in the first place, so this is more or less obsolete. A +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls is an overkill, because normally a firearm deals superior damage, even compared to some of the most powerful non-firearm weapons. Not to mention that firearm cannot gain any benefits from your barbarian features.

---

My great question is: Why is this a barbarian subclass in the first place? None of the features actually work fine with what is expected from barbarian. When some of the most prominent subclass features conflict with the core class features, that's what I would call for an overhaul.
",DnDHomebrew,[5e] Need feedback on a Joker inspired Barbarian Subclass,5e Workshop
892,e4gjdlo,98jfdo,"Hallo there! Let's see what we have here:

I strongly recommend you use [Homebrewery](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com) or [GM Binder](https://www.gmbinder.com) for your homebrew materials.

**1st level.** Needs more specific. So this gives you an unique set of armor and weapon. Armor and weapon need better stats.

**2nd level.** You might want to use paladin's Divine Sense for this.

2nd level is *way* too fast for damage resistance, it makes a very delicious dipping material. Try moving it up to at least 10th level.

There is no ""resistance to environment"". I think the word you are looking for would be ""you have advantage on the saving throw made to avoid or resist the effect of extreme heat"".

**5th level.** Casting *heat metal* at will is too much.

Ignoring resistance and immunity is way too much. This should not be passive, but must be used with cost.

Do you really need unarmed strike bonus? It seems that all your attacks are based on chains.

**6th level.** Extra ASI is only given to fighter and rogue for now, but I think there must be a reason you decided to add this in addition to subclass feature. But keep in mind that most classes are already happy with five ASIs.

**7th level.** Making chain magical can be brought down to 5th level.

I don't think you really need ""block missile"" stuff.

**9th level.** Extra Attack should come at 5th level.

Rooting sounds good, but I don't see why you need this. Is this very, very necessary?

**10th level.** Making one additional attack on a miss seems a bit much. If this is an offhand attack, why not just engage in two-weapon fighting?

**13th level.** Yes, no immunity at this level. Try resistance.

**14th level.** And here comes yet another ASI. I don't think this is very necessary.

**15th level.** No, hellfire already ignores resistance and deals half damage against immunity, I don't think it's a balanced way to double the damage.

**18th level.** Is Fiend warlock's Hurl Through Hell, but with even more benefits.

**20th level.** Casting *shapechange* on yourself but with more benefits. I suggest you might want to see how paladin's capstone features give awesome benefits *without* using other creature's stat block for reference.

**Issues.** My issues would be summed into: I don't see the concept of this class. So you use chain and fire damage, but what makes you very different from other classes? This is a draft, so I should refrain from overly bashing the work-in-progress material, but this seems like an odd combination of fighter, paladin, and ranger, with some fiend-related stuffs and fire damage thrown into.

**Suggestions.** My suggestions would be something like this:

- I think you can first start with a subclass for other class, say, a ranger, and try build your ideas into a class. Subclass is way easier to brew than a full class, and by creating subclasses you can learn how to integrate your idea into a class, and what makes each class unique and awesome. I think this is a very awesome ranger subclass material, so I suggest this.
- Find one or two gimmicks that your class should provide and other classes just cannot. Fighter grants four Extra Attacks, Action Surge, and two extra ASIs; monk has Martial Arts and ki features; ranger has exclusive spells, superior outdoor exploration features, and animal companion subclass, you name it. I think you should focus on the unique weapon (chain) for starters.
- I can direct you to some good guidelines: [*Unearthed Arcana* article ""Modifying Classes""](http://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/UA3_ClassDesignVariants.pdf) and [D&D Wiki's 5e Class Design Guide](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_Class_Design_Guide).

Ever wanted to yell ""stop hitting yourself"" at an enemy? *Reversal* might be the spell for you.

Continuing on with new reaction spells for the classes, *reversal* is a 3rd-level spell that allows you to swap places with an opponent mid attack, forcing them to attack themselves.

I agonized a bit over what level to put this spell at. At first, I was thinking it was way overpowered. Reversing a *guiding bolt* could be game changing! But, looking at some of the stronger creatures and spells in the game, there doesn't seem to be anything game breaking that requires a ranged attack.

That's not to say the spell is useless. Really the utility of this spell is to re-position enemy characters forcefully. The potential extra damage on top is a nice perk.

Some tricky strategies I can imagine with this spell:

* Some obnoxious low CR guards or kobolds flinging bolts at you and your friends from up high? Swap places with one of them to get on their level.
* Use the *fly* spell and go harass some ranged casters. Then, watch them fall to the ground after you switch places with them.
* Need to get out of your location and fast? Have an ally throw a dart at you and swap places with them. Sure, they'll get hurt, but *you'll be fine.*

Tattoos, both magical and mundane, have been a part of D&D for many years though there have been little to no actual rules for them. Several 3rd party guides have been written and many have been modifications of guides that came before them. This guide is no different. The aim here is to provide simple and streamlined rules for tattoos avoiding much of the fluff and flavour, such as cultures and history, leaving all that up to your own world setting.

909,gqsp8qc,m46c9c,"Among the fiercest fighters in colonial militias, the ""ready in a minute"" men were handpicked from muster rolls for their patriotism, marksmanship, and physical strength. Expected to keep their arms with them at all times, Revolutionary minutemen were especially prevalent in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts after the occupation of Boston by the British Army in 1768. Demonstrations of military force inflamed tensions between the king's men and his subjects, and prior to the outbreak of hostilities incidents like the Powder Alarm in 1774 drove many to join the ranks of the minutemen. Of course, minutemen are most famous today for ""the shot heard round the world"" that began the Revolutionary War. Though their initial force was routed in a direct confrontation with the redcoats at Lexington, more minutemen quickly arrived as the British tried to disengage. The battle evolved into a running fight, culminating in a patriot victory at Concord Bridge.

On the other side, highlanders were among the most ardent loyalists who participated in the early actions of the war. Living mostly in rural areas of Georgia and the Carolinas, settlements of highland Scots immigrants remained somewhat insular and fiercely loyal to the crown. When war broke out, many highlanders volunteered to fight for the British governors in the south and their campaigns to recapture colonies in revolt. Though these provincial forces were poorly supplied and often had little to no ammunition, the highlanders were unquestionably brave and frequently engaged their enemies in hand-to-hand combat. At the Battle of Moore’s Creek Bridge in North Carolina, a contingent of broadsword-wielding Scotsmen attempted a highland charge against a superior force armed with muskets and rifles. They were repulsed by the patriot militias, and loyalist activity in the south was scattered for years until a second British offensive in 1778.

Continuing down the path I started with Arc Blade, Frost Blade is another elemental ""blade"" spell designed to fill in the gaps around Booming & Green-Flame Blade. This is the first in that cycle of spells with an overtly defensive function. It doesn't do any extra damage until you reach 5th level, but it just might save you a few hits that would have struck you or an ally.

D&D needs some more nuanced, morally ambiguous factions in my opinion. So, I'm back with more from **The Heretics.** I've updated it quite a bit since my last post!

Designed to be a morally complex group, Heretics believe that the material plane would be much better off if the gods would just stop getting involved in everything all the time. As such, they're very anti-religious but very pro-humanity.

This document includes general information about the Heretic organization as well as a number of stat blocks to use in your own campaign. I've also included strategies for each ""monster"", so that you have a few ideas on how to use them in a campaign.

I'm planning to continue working on this a bit more but thought it was just about ready to share. Please feel free to provide feedback.  :)  Hope you have fun making your players feel weird about the gods!

* The Scatter propertie and the carfting DC were simplified.
* Both Feats are now focused on either one-handed or two-handed firearms.
* Two firearms related items were added.

920,gq9fbdl,m0rfi8,"This is actually one of my favorite subclasses I’ve made. It borrows a few things from divination Wizard, namely the portent ability. I’ve always found the Cleric subclasses to be lacking in archetypal design. Cleric fills the priest role in 5E, but lacks subclasses that feel priest-like outside of Life Domain, and arguably Grave or Knowledge Domain. I aimed to fix that with an archetypal Oracle subclass.

Oracles in fantasy have always been some of my favorite characters to write for, as I love the idea of oracles being normal people who are stuck with the gift of prophecy. Realistically, it’s extremely difficult to interpret the future as most Oracles would see it without context. For that reason, most of the Class Features you receive focus on altering specific moments throughout your adventuring day.

Clerics typically get access to most of the low-mid level divination spells, but it didn’t seem right to not grant them these spells innately. As such, you’ll find that many of the spells you get aren’t new spells, but they are spells that you would likely take anyway, taking a lot of the pressure off the Cleric to prepare all these spells every day.

The Class Features themselves I found to be challenging to design, as Divination Wizard already presents itself as an Oracle character, but Priests and Clerics are often oracles in fantasy as well. While Prophecy Domain does borrow Portent from the Divination Wizard, it receives plenty of brand new abilities to utilize on adventures.

Oracle Spirit- this particular ability is the typical Proficiency/Knowledge ability all clerics receive. I specifically chose two knowledge skills and two face skills to make up the list, determining the Prophets would require these skills for specific reasons Persuasion: The ability to convince people that they’re telling the truth about the future and attempt to sway them from a path that might lead them to an unsavory end. Deception: the ability to lie about the future, possibly to spare a creature from knowledge that would harm them, or even to intentionally steer them towards a future they may wish to avoid. Arcana: this one was a little more complex. It made sense to me that oracles would have knowledge of magic and magic items, and skill checks that Arcana is used for seemed to be something that I’d want to be good at if I were using this Domain History: it seems to me that it’d be critical for an Oracle or prophet to be able to recall past information as easily as they could foresee future information. If I were playing this subclass, I’d want to be able to easily recall past prophecies, even ones I didn’t foretell myself.

Fortune Teller- similar to Bardic Inspiration or the various +1d4 spells like aid, this ability exists as a way for the Cleric to help guide a character towards their destiny. As opposed to simply telling a character their future, Fortune Teller gently nudges the PC towards a favorable outcome.

Channel Divinity: Divine Insight- instead of relying on your own knowledge, this feature attempts to make use of your gods knowledge, allowing you to cast divination spells without expending a spell slot. Divination Wizard gets the extremely potent Expert Divination ability, which creates a very helpful trickle down of your spell slots, allowing you to cast a good handful of your divination spells before an important encounter. While probably not as potent, a free casting of a divination spell a few times a day can be extremely impactful. Remember that you get up to 3 uses between short rests, so you could potentially use this up to 9 times per session, maybe more. Even at low levels you should get a couple uses of this per session.

Fortelling Dream- try as I might, I simply couldn’t compete with Divination Wizard. Portent is an extremely powerful ability, so it felt unfair to not let Prophecy Domain use it too. It’s called Fortelling Dream because initially, I wanted to give the Cleric a way to see the future through dreams, but aside from giving the DM control of this ability and letting them decide to share information with the PC through a Dream, there wasn’t much else I could think of besides Portent.

Potent Spellcasting- it was this or divine strike, and this class is not a front liner.

High Prophet- Cleric doesn’t normally get Foresight, which felt like an oversight to me. A free casting of this spell is extremely powerful, and as such is limited to once at least every other day, and at most, once a week. It initially had a static time limit of one week, but it felt too restrictive. The way it’s written now prevents it from coming up too many times in one session. There’s actually a typo here. The way it’s written makes it sound like you still require material components. You do not. It should say “without expending a spell slot or requiring material components.” I’ll get that fixed soon.

This is for sure one of my favorite subclasses, at least in terms of flavor. Like I said, I love Oracles in fantasy, and Divination Wizard just doesn’t really do it for me.

*6th-level conjuration (ritual)*

* **Casting Time:** 1 action
* **Range:** 15 feet
* **Components:** V, S, M (40 gold pieces, or mineral goods of equivalent value, which the spell consumes or one chest miniature of a set of two, each worth at least 400 gp)
* **Duration:** 1 hour
* **Classes:** Warlock, Wizard

You summon a Medium air elemental to a spot within range. The air elemental is formless, nearly transparent, immune to all damage, and cannot interact with other creatures or objects. It carries an open, empty chest whose interior dimensions are four feet on each side. Besides a lid, the chest also has a latching mechanism on the front face that allows the top two feet of the face to swing down, making the bottom of the chest accessible.

While the spell lasts, you can deposit as many items inside the chest as will fit. You can then name a living creature you have met and seen at least once before or present a body part, such as a lock of hair or nail clipping, from a creature with which you are unfamiliar. When you do so, the elemental disappears with the chest, then reappears adjacent to the target creature. If the target creature is on another plane, or if it is proofed against magical detection or location, the elemental fails to deliver the chest.

Upon delivery, the target creature is made aware of the chest’s contents before it chooses whether or not to open it. It also learns how long it has before the chest is returned. No other creature can open the chest, access its contents, or stow objects in it. The elemental stays with the chest until either the spell expires or the target creature orders the elemental to return the chest to you. Before that time, the target creature may freely take objects from and place objects into the chest.

When the elemental returns the chest (either because it couldn't deliver it to the target, the target ordered it to return, or the spell ended), it reappears adjacent to you, deposits the chest on the ground, and disappears. You are made aware of the contents of the chest before you choose whether or not to open it. The chest disappears and spills its contents in ten minutes or when the spell expires, whichever is longer.

If you cast this spell using the chest miniature as the material component, you may only send the chest to the owner of the other chest miniature in the set. You can designate a creature as the owner of a chest miniature with a special ritual casting of this spell when you, the creature, and both miniatures are within range. The elemental fails to find the target if you cast the spell in this way and the target is more than 100 feet from its chest miniature.

When you cast this spell ritually, you may only cast it using a chest miniature as the material component.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, you can send the chest to a creature on a different plane of existence from you.",DnDHomebrew,"Greater Speedy Courier – 6th-Level Conjuration – ""Greater"" Version of Galder's Speedy Courier",5e

I have been working over the past few months on a lot of content. Too much, some might say (including myself at times). The reason for this is because I have been working diligently on a massive project: my own setting guide. This setting, known as **Yvarra**, has been the primary setting for my home games for years and I am excited to announce that I am making a complete guide for it. This guide, known as **Yorviing’s Guide to Yvarra** will feature a brand new setting filled with [strange and unusual gods and demigods](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MGQEKDQ9U67Wtw7Ql0A), forgotten and ancient magic, and terrifying creatures that lurk in the dark. This setting book will aim to give both players and GMs alike with a wealth of options to run campaigns and stories within Yvarra, and I hope to release a preview of the project soon!

Today I decided to show off one of the cleric subclasses that is going into YGY after being revised and altered. Today’s subclass, **Arcane Tradition: Pyromancy**, is a subclass focused on wielding and mastering the art of flame. To pyromancers, fire is not just a tool for destruction; fire symbolizes rebirth, purity, divinity, and the spark of life.   

I decided to keep the artwork a bit more simple on this one too, to make it just easier to understand (and also not super edgy)

I hope you are all having a great day, and I hope that everyone enjoys this new subclass — **Arcane Tradition: Pyromancy (Revised)** :D

They believe that destruction is the only way the universe can have stability. Many of these druids are deemed as psychos, murderers, and just pure evil.

Arcane duelist is a flashy, teleportation based class, where the original focus being on the weapon switching skill.

In addition to the lack of a specified DC that has already been mentioned, the language in Gravity Pulse needs to be cleaned up a bit to conform to 5e standards. For example, it should probably specify that creatures are pulled in a straight line (or ""directly"" to you) and they are pulled to an ""unoccupied space"". These sorts of abilities can get pretty wordy, but an ounce of specificity now saves a pound of arguing later.

You might find some additional inspiration in the gravity-based ""Myrmidon"" class I made earlier this year. I've been trying to playtest it for months, but that has been going slowly (one campaign completely imploded and other has missed more sessions than it has had.)

[The Cardmaster](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/V-K-wq8cT) uses an unconventional mechanic to prepare spells that means they'll never quite know what they're bringing to the adventure.

There are currently five archetypes (with more planned!) that enhance the capabilities of the Cardmaster's Core to thematically fit the original classes of D&D, acting as a sort of dip without giving access to the most powerful aspects of each class.

Currently the progression of each archetype is very similar, enhancing the same abilities at the same time (with the notable exception of Sorcererous Cardmasters gaining access to more spells earlier than the other classes) but in ways thematically appropriate for their archetype.

The class is not 'based' on a certain League of Legends character, I just like the art.

I also need to credit Artem Bank's 'The Dealer 5e' homebrew for having a couple nifty ideas that I appropriated.

I've tried to keep the writing style as close to original 5e as possible, while keeping fluff and useless abilities to a minimum.

**As u/aethelwolf corrected in a comment, my damage calculations for level 11 were off for versatile fighting because each calculation should add an additional 5 damage for the third attack that Fighter's get at that level. I still believe that the damage is fair because those averages assume that the first weapon attack hits, instead of a later one which would decrease the average damage because you wouldn't be able to use two-handed attacks until you land a one-handed attack. There's also the issue that at higher levels more enemies will have resistance to the nonmagical damage of your unarmed strikes. The damage is higher than I originally thought though, so I will definitely consider that moving forward!**

Hello Adventurers!

I’ve decided to post a new homebrew every week in an effort to raise money for the International Medical Corps. Here’s post #17!

Fighting Style - Versatile Fighting

I had a few primary goals in creating this fighting style:

(1) I wanted to make a style that encouraged the use of the “versatile” property of weapons. For Versatile Fighting, when you get extra attack, you could attack one-handed until you hit to trigger the bonus action attack, and then you could make two-handed attacks for the rest of the turn. You could also switch to two-handed for opportunity attacks.

(2) I wanted to make a style that synergized with races that have natural weapons that can be used for unarmed strikes like the Tabaxi, Lizardfolk, and Minotaur. In my experience, I’ve rarely seen those traits used which is a shame because the idea of a minotaur weaving horn attacks throughout their strikes seems so natural and cool.

(3) I wanted to make a fighting style that favored Strength characters over Dexterity characters because I feel like Dexterity is a bit of an overrepresented ability in 5e.

(4) I wanted a fighting style that gave a fighter choices in combat. Do you use the unarmed strike for extra damage or try to shove to give yourself and your melee allies advantage? Do I want to switch to two-handed attacks this turn, so I can use my bonus action for something else?

**Math**

Here’s some numbers calculating the average damage for Versatile Fighting and comparable fighting styles. I assumed optimal stat distribution.

*AT 1ST LEVEL*

Versatile Fighting (costs a bonus action, and you can’t use a shield)

Unarmed Strike: 1d8 + 3 + 4 =11.5

Shove Attack: 1d8 + 3 + Shove = 7.5

Minotaur: 1d8 + 3 + 1d6 + 3 = 14

Two-Weapon Fighting (costs a bonus action, and you can’t use a shield)

1d6 + 3 + 1d6 + 3 = 13

Dueling (doesn’t cost a bonus action, and you can use a shield)

1d8 + 5 = 9.5

Great Weapon Fighting (doesn’t cost a bonus action, but you can’t use a shield)

2d6 + 3 + 1 = 11.

*5TH LEVEL*

Versatile Fighting

Unarmed Strike: 1d8 + 1d10 + 8 + 5 = 23

Shove: 1d8 + 1d10 + 8 + Shove = 18

Minotaur: 1d8 + 1d10 + 8 + 1d6 + 4 = 25.5

TWF

3d6 + 12 = 22.5

Dueling

2d8 + 12 = 21

GWF

4d6 + 10 = 24

*11TH LEVEL*

Versatile Fighting

Unarmed Strike: 1d8 + 2d10 + 15 + 6 = 36.5

Shove: 1d8 + 2d10 + 15 + Shove = 30.5

Minotaur: 1d8 + 2d10 + 15 + 1d6 + 5 = 39

TWF

4d6 + 20 = 34

Dueling

3d8 + 21 = 34.5

GWF

6d6 + 15 = 36

So early on, Versatile Fighting competes with other high-damage fighting styles, and if you choose Minotaur it even surpasses others styles in damage, but the damage is less consistent because to get the effect, you need to land two hits: the initial hit with your weapon and the second hit with your unarmed strike. Dueling and GWF only require the original hit to get the benefit of the extra damage, and TWF let’s you attack twice whether you hit with the first attack or not. I’m also fine with Minotaurs surpassing in damage because the race is a little low on the power scale.

At later levels, Versatile Fighting falls behind other fighting styles, but with the extra attacks, you’ll be more likely to land a hit and gain the benefit of the unarmed strike or shove, improving the style’s consistency. That’s all I’ve got for my design reasoning, but if you have any comments or suggestions, I’d love to hear them!

They’re a global humanitarian organization that both provides direct medical assistance to areas in need and helps those areas develop their own healthcare systems. You can learn more about their mission [here.](https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/what-we-do/) They’re pretty busy right now, so I thought this would be a good way to help them out. If you can donate something, great! If you can’t right now, that’s fine too! Please enjoy the Versatile Fighting Style either way :)

981,g3cd454,ijbb3l,"Travel  & Exploration Lite is a lightweight ruleset for use in D&D 5e  campaigns featuring exploration. The complexity and mechanical heft of other travel rules are traded for streamlined simplicity.

The intent is to invoke the feeling of being separated from the comforts of civilization without bogging down the game.

[Check out version 3.0 of these rules here on GM Binder](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-Lcshwv-ApTzjtfy7Rx-/-MEr6KFuTo2hgxLJiT0V).

&#x200B;

This is a ruleset I've been working on over the past year for my home game,  which features exploring an unmapped mysterious island. I wanted to use  some travel rules that were a bit more fulfilling than the ones  presented in the DMG and XGtE, but when looking at many of the other homebrew travel and exploration rules out there, I found them  overwhelmingly complex. So, in time-honored fashion, I decided to make  my own.

Each concept in Travel & Exploration Lite is limited to a single page, so it is easy to  customize to your table's needs. Want to use the travel rules, but not  the camping rules? Go for it!

Two  major features of Travel & Exploration Lite are the modified resting  rules and the use of passive scores. In this ruleset, a Short Rest  requires 8 hours, and every 7th Short Rest is considered a Long Rest. This help to ensure that smaller encounters still present a challenge on  the road, where the party must make strategic decisions to conserve  their resources. Likewise, the use of passive scores helps to streamline  travel and exploration when characters can easily succeed at travel  activities such as navigation and hunting. However, when these  activities become more difficult, the rules come back into play as  survivalist challenges present themselves.

&#x200B;

I  would like to thank my players and the members of this community for  their feedback over the past year, and I eagerly welcome your feedback, suggestions, and critique.

982,g62sus3,ijbb3l,"Hey, great questions!  


1. In the [previous major edit of these rules](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-Lcshwv-ApTzjtfy7Rx-/-M7aAdGZjWVhwX855B6n), I had a diagram showing the breakdown of a traveling day (assuming a 24-hour day). In short, your assessment is correct, though I had broken down ""camp time"" into ""free time"" and ""rest""  
The intended difference between a **travel day** and a **camping day** is you are not traveling during a camping day, and are instead using the 12 hours normally allotted to travel and camp set up/take down for Camp Activities.
2. The last 12 hours of any travel or camping day are broken down into 4 hours of free time and 8 hours of rest.
3. This is a good catch! In my previous version, I had more explicitly stated that Free Time is the time at the end of the day, before Rest. However, I shortened that language in the most recent version, and that clarification got lost. I will make that more clear in the next update.
4. Someone else brought this up as well. You can also see in the previous version that I had rules for fast pace (4 miles per hour), but I removed them because I thought they created too much bloat. In the next update, I will probably add a brief section in the Variant Rules for fast pace travel

So... something a little different today.

This is an adventure. For 5e D&D. Technically. Let's back up a bit.

I'm not really an adventure writer, or even adventurer player. I mostly homebrew all my games in long rambling campaigns with boring politics and over serious plots that manage to involve economics as much as magic. And when I'm not running that, I'm obsessively balancing homebrew player options.

This, on the other hand, is a one shot about level 1 players being abducted by a spaceship and having to shoot their way free with grossly overpowered laser guns.

That may sound ridiculous, and it definitely is. My philosophy with one-shots is generally that they are a chance to do something I wouldn't ever want to do in a normal campaign

It was never my intention to turn that into published thing, but the players quite enjoyed. I ended up mentioning this in [an interview](https://artificialtwenty.home.blog/2020/09/19/an-interview-with-veteran-homebrewer-kibblestasty/) I did awhile back and consequently quite a few people reached out to me that they wanted to play it.

I am not an adventure writer, but I also am not one to decline the will of the people, so I wrote up more or less what I ran, and one of my players was even kind enough to get a Battle Map commissioned for it (they had to play with my crude hand drawn maps!)

I want to make one point clear though... this is not a balanced or normal adventure, and was never intended to. My players survived it, but it can easily go toward a TPK in some places, and the weapons are so OP to completely override class choices and heavily warp how combat works. It's a very silly thing!

The full res version of the Battlemap I've decided to throw up on my patreon at the $1 tier. It's not necessary to play the one-shot... hell, when I ran my players had to make do with my crudely hand drawn version. But one my players commissioned it, so I figure it'll make a new bonus to the experience.

987,gbtq1uq,jrkvyr,"**Design Notes:**

Well, the source of inspiration here is pretty obvious, being nothing more than the infamous Magic the Gathering 5/5 trample reenvisioning of its also famous earlier relative, the Phyrexian Negator. The aesthetic and concept of this creature were too cool to pass up making a thematic monster on, so here we go. I always envisioned these guys as ravenous, custom-engineered abominations of war that seek only to destroy and lay waste and are more or less simply unleashed on anything that its masters want utterly annihilated.

To that end, and taking cues from the card, I designed them as deadly, and highly aggressive/offensive monsters that delight in wading into the thick of combat and viciously retaliate against harm.

Since I know most campaigns won't be set in the MTG universe I've provided suitably generic background fluff that should let them slot in comfortably to most settings.

Werewolves, and weretigers, and werebears, oh my!

So the concept of making racial variants (a variant set of features that can be applied to any race) has been something I've been playing around with for a while. I've made a few of my own that can be found in my Racial Compendium on DMsGuild, but werewolves and the lot seemed like a natural fit for this. 

Thus, Therianthropy was born!

This version has a few updates I'll outline below. You'll also notice that werebats and ravens are still missing. I may add them later, but the whole mess of balancing flight abilities does not appeal to me at this time.

993,g7a0954,j377cv,"**Design Notes:**

Clearly inspired by/drived from the iconic Dark Souls enemy, the Darkwraith has been ported over to 5E with a bit of creative license/localization to make it both more easily slot in with most settings, and to make it mechanically more interesting and suited to the system, featuring things like a deadly smite, and a short range teleportation to help deal with ranged threats; think of it as a localization of the Red Eye Orb. That having been said, all of its iconic abilities and flavour are there.

The Darkwraith features a de facto 'Defensive' mode where its Void Shield is active, granting it considerable defensive buffs, and an offensive mode while the shield is retracted, where it maximizes DPR, using its sword two-handed, its Vile Smite ability and Life Drain to siphon the souls of your PCs.

* While this ready to be used and being used by many people, it also a pre-1.0 version. There will be errors and mistakes. A lot of work is going into this system, and it has a lot of moving parts. 

* This system has many branches; I've previously posted Blacksmithing, and this is Alchemy. Enchanting, Scrollcraft, Cooking and Tinkering are all in progress in various states; it'll be awhile after this before anything else is posted, but if you want to preview any of those, they are my patreon at the $1 tier as the master doc for the WIP crafting system.

* Personally I don't use the pricing listed. These prices have been adapted to be compatible with games running more standard PHB/DMG gold values than I use, and from the feedback so far are a reasonable adaption, but personally I use a much more compressed system.

* [New Disclaimer] This has some instances where I've used my own version of something marked via ^K^; you can feel free to replace this with the default version if you'd like, the balance assumptions would be the same.

The following is an introduction to my crafting system, which is the same as with the blacksmithing post (well, besides a few typo fixes and the like):

____ 

## Why do you need Crafting?
Some people may wonder - why do you need a crafting system? Isn't that what loot is for? The truth is, in some games, that's true. Not every adventurer is going to want to pursue crafting. But with a crafting system, not only can you craft what you need without finding it in a dragon hoard, what you find in that dragon hoard can be so much more.

In a game with a robust crafting system, there is no junk, there is just more opportunities and fresh possibilities. A +1 shortsword that no one can use could be the valuable basis of a new spear. Gems, gold, relics, and recyclables... all valid entry points for the crafters creativity. 

Adventurers are inherently innovative folks on a quest for creative solutions to difficult problems. Crafting gives them that toolbox.

So... why do you need crafting? You don't. But you should probably want it.

### Who can craft?
Anyone! Who can succeed in making something useful? Perhaps a bit of a different story. Crafting is not inherently tied to class, though in some cases some classes may give benefits to it (like Artificer); crafting may come from your background in the form of a tool proficiency, or it may be something you learn during your adventures following the old adage of necessity being the mother of invention.

Crafting is mostly about the time, effort, knowledge and materials. As such, most of crafting is knowing the recipe and having the time and materials needed... but a skilled craftsman works quicker and is more successful, and in this business practice makes perfect, so there are various progression modifiers that apply. Your DM can determine if your background would merit starting your adventure with any, otherwise guidelines for how to gain them are included.

### What can I craft?
Anything! But this guide is made by a mere mortal, and is thus limited in scope. This guide will provide the principles of crafting for many fields - from alchemy to engineering to woodworking. 

The basis of how crafting works is similar between each field, but the recipes, material, and most important results will be radically different... After all, a healing potion, a catapult, and a magic sword are all things you can craft, but the process for each varies quite a bit.

The goal of this document is teach you how to get started, and provide the basics that will get you a long way into your adventure, but not make a complete codex of everything that could potentially be crafted. When you hit something that doesn't appear in this document, just reference the closest items and make a bit of a leap to what extra steps might be needed to realize your vision into your D&D world!

### A Player Driven System
One of the fundamental goals and inspirations of the crafting system is to make it a player driven system. It is a system where the player can say ""**I** would like to harvest the monster for ingredients"" and ""**I** would like to forage as we go through the forest looking for alchemy reagents"" and ultimately ""**I** would like to make a healing potion"" and all those rules can be exposed in a PHB like style to the player. The DM still adjudicates many instances of them, but the ideal is to have a system in which the DM does not have to handcraft every instance of gathering materials and crafting.

### Hooking Your Players In
On the other hand, if the DM wants to get the players into it, there are some tools they can use. By far the most effective tool is to give the players reagents as part of loot that don't have an obvious place to sell them. If you give players 2 curative reagents, they are going to start looking into how they can use those, as they'd much rather have a healing potion.

If you want to go one further though, if you give them *5* curative reagents and they realize they will have a remainder of one... then they start looking into ""Well, how do we get a 6th!""

### Depth and Complexity
This system has two goals: to be simple and easy to use, and to be deep and extensible. Naturally these are somewhat at odds, and accomplished by having a great deal of optional depth. To produce standard items with standard effects, the process for finding or buying the materials and using them to make what you want to make will be straightforward. However, it always allows a degree of customization and specificity for those that look further. Whipping up a potion of healing is fairly easy, but you can also delve into the custom potions and brew something entirely unique.

How much of the detail you want to engage with as a DM can be easily adjusted by how you hand out reagents. By sticking to the standard ingredients and using their generic names, the materials are no more complicated than handing out gold or other rewards (and can even be fully converted easily to a gold based system if you want the most simplified version), but if you'd like to have specific ingredient names and exotic ingredients with special effects, those are there for you to pull from.

##### Generic Ingredients
Above and throughout the document, you will see that ingredients are referred to by generic tags like ""common curative reagent"" rather than specific natures. For example, you may harvest magical herbs, and find Kingsbane in the forest, a poisonous plant. For the purposes of crafting, this can be recorded simply as a ""common poisonous reagent"" and used as such in crafting. 

This greatly simplifies the process of crafting and recording what your supplies are. Narratively speaking, a skilled alchemist can render down the ingredients they want to use in the form they need.

Each crafting profession will have some profession wide materials that are used in their recipes - reagents for alchemy, metals for blacksmithing, etc.

tbh while I like a lot of his work, I dont like the alchemy aspect of that artificer either. it just seems like everyone wants an alchemist so we shoehorn it in to places it doesnt exist. historically IRL (I know it doesnt HAVE to be with reference to IRL things) alchemists are healers. there are no alchemical treatises IRL that have ANYTHING other than healing preparations. The fantasy idea of an alchemist being some mad scientist that rains down destruction via chemicals is just silly to me. As a real-life spagyricist, who mainly DM's a group that consists of an herbalist, another spagyricist and a chemist with a background in ""occult"" history (like myself) we just arent interested in that because it comes of as silly to us, the way ""asian"" style monk characters seem out of place and absurd to people that prefer very euro-centric settings. so I set out to make a more realistic alchemist (to my mind) that is JUST an alchemist, not an artificer or what have you that has a nod to some abstract idea of alchemy. But regardless of real life, if you cant fight, you wont get far in d&d, so there is some offense to the class we are working on but trying to keep it balanced and focused on the lab-centric reality of what alchemy is.

we are currently working on this: (it is not playtested beyond level 10, and the ""gustbow"" will eventually be a subclass that focuses on that, and other subclasses will be expanded. only so many players to playtest with though)

These turkeys are mostly similar to their goblin counterparts, with an altered Nimble Escape and reskinned Martial Advantage. The only big change is the Gobble Gobble ability, which functions much like a *thunderwave*.

I'd be more concerned that these turkeys speak a secret Fowl language ...

1001,g8w9qr4,jbnfms,"### What is this?

This is a framework that does essentially two things - provides a structure you can use to give your players concrete progress and assets in their efforts of building up an army, and provides an overlay (in the form of a deck building card game) for a D&D 5e combat encounter that turns that combat encounter in the heart of a raging battle - with your PCs at the center of it.

### Why did I make this?

I had a problem that I imagine many DMs have had over the years. I had written myself into an epic confrontation between the players, and a literal horde of hobgoblins - teeming with siege weapons, dragons, the whole nine yards. My player had started to build an army, but as the confrontation loomed, the question of how I was going to actually *run* the fight became an ever present issue. I've done various ""war"" scenarios before, and tried everything from dodging the issue completely to rolling dice to full on pseudo wargames, but never really felt I'd hit the correct balance between ""let the players play 5e"" and ""give the players satisfying rewards for the efforts in building an army"" and ""give players agency over how the battle plays out"".

So I sat down to solve this problem for my game, and I ended up spending way too much time on that solution, but maybe made a system that you can use so you don't have to.

### How It Works

It is actually quite simple how it works. Players build their army - this is them playing the game of D&D. Finding NPCs that will help them, gathering allied forces, that sort of thing. These become assets in the players struggle. Did your players convince an old-washed up hero that the goblin army coming was bad news? They got themselves an Elite. Did they get that old hero back into shape? Reward them with an extra Battle Card! Rally the villages, get General Forces! You'll need all the help they can get, because the enemy horde is vast! But be sure to find yourself a stalwart leader (like [our Warlord here](https://www.gmbinder.com/images/3ORYq56.png)!) as without good leadership, and army is but a pile of corpses!

Once the time for battle comes, the following plays out.

* There are two armies, represented by **General Forces** and **Elites**, with **Leaders**.
* The clash in an epic fight, in at the heart of which is the **Skirmish** where the players play out 5e combat.
* The tactical layer is simulated by **Battle Cards** representing the actions of **Elites** and **Leaders**.
* The strength of an army is represented by Fielded Strength and it's will to fight by Morale, both of which are reduced by Casualties.

That's it. That's the system.  The rest of the words will just serve to explain what the bolded words mean, provide tools to construct them in a manner that works for your campaign, and run them in an epic and memorable battle.

* **General Forces** are the bulk of your forces; it can be nameless or named NPCs, but they are typically in the lower CR range. They vitally provide the bulk of your **Fielded Strength**.
* **Elites** are typically your more powerful allies or followers. They vitally provide you with the **Battle Cards** that make up your aforemented deck-building-card game. They determine how many cards you can *draw* and *hold*.
* **Leaders** are the people that make your army go; you can have one that provides a multiplier to your force, and the rest provide additional bonuses. They determine how many cards you can *play* per round.
* **Siege Weapons** are unnecessary, but nice to have, and give you powerful bonus Battle Cards.

But that's just your army. What's this about a **Skirmish**? What are the all important PCs doing? The PCs can be found at the heart of the Skirmish in the heat of the Battle, where they use D&D 5e combat rules to engage the enemy **Elites** and slaughter their General Forces with their actual characters. The actions of the PCs in the Skirmish will greatly impact the overall state of the Battle, but they cannot win a war alone, and you'll need all three parts - General Forces, Elites with their Battle Cards, and the PCs in the Skirmish to overcome the enemy forces.

The Skirmish will contain an enemy Elite (of the DMs choosing) and a flood of the General Forces. Enemies killed here both deplete the enemies General Forces and Morale, but boost your own. It also gives you the chance to take out enemy elites and snowball the fight in your favor, routing them for good. The less elites they have, they less Battle Cards they are deploying against you.

### Design Notes & FAQ

> Why Deck Building Card Game? 

It turned out to be a really easy way to get players to engage with the tactical level of warfare without feeling like they were setting up for Warhammer. Some people will obviously like a less abstracted version, but this version lets you have the narratively cool bits that makes it clear what you and your allies (and the dastardly villains)

> How Do You Actually Play It?

I'm not going to lie, I designed this to play in person, and it works a lot better that way. That said, since the world is the world and that's off the table for me at the moment (and many of you folks I'm sure), I've been playing and tested it in Roll20. They have a feature that allows you to build a deck of cards. I just build 2 decks; one for players and one for DM. The players cards I deal face up on the map and let them decide what to do, the DM cards I deal to myself and play onto the map. The system assumes the DM knows the players cards (but has a large corresponding disadvantage built in for the DM as they have to play their cards first allowing the player to much more easily counter them).

> All of this for 1 battle?

It's possible that a single battle could resolve the war, but generally I would expect a series of them. You may lose and be routed the first time, and be the frantic hunt for new allies and cards to counter the particularly savage enemy Battle Cards! You may defeat their expeditionary force only to find their main force not far behind. Once war breaks out, the need for a battle system tends to grow.

> How much work for the DM is this?

A fair bit. A lot less than making it from scratch, a lot more than telling your players to roll a d20 to see how the battle goes. It'll usually take less than an hour to generate an NPC army, how long the players army takes depends on how much you integrate that into your campaign. Setting up decks in roll20 is a bit of a pain, but doesn't take more than 10-15 minutes. I just use a master-token for both armies tracking their fielded strength and morale, and record the damage they take to those like I'd record damage to any unit - I let the players see their army, but not the enemy army stats. It's pretty doable. 

> Is it actually fun?

So far, all the players/playtesters have wanted to play again/more. That's a loose metric, but it's what I got.

> What if I don't run warfare in my 5e game?

Than you don't need this system. But perhaps keep it in mind for if it ever sneaks up on you :)

> Who is KibblesTasty?

I make Homebrew stuff for D&D 5e. I have a [website](https://www.kthomebrew.com/), and have made stuff like the [Warlord](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LW4agTNJcbwe6kSv4H2), [Psion](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LZSNMgmChWNGW979hrj), [Occultist (Witches, Shamans, Oracles)](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-M-WtrKeZNFdEXq0MKXw), and [Alternate Artificer](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LAEn6ZdC6lYUKhQ67Qk).

If you want to support my stuff, I have a [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/KibblesTasty) which is what allows me make all this stuff.

> What'll you do with this from here?

I will continue to test and play it myself, as well as take in feedback and tweak it. It is not and never will be a 100% plug and play system - it's a framework for you to apply to your campaign and build around your player's situations, NPCs, and allies. Your players will want custom cards, and they make great alternate loot - even rewards for character development or building relationships with their NPCs! But I will refine the base system, and expand the default cards quite a bit (generally aim to give each class 3-4 options per level, and build out a few dozen template Elites. If there's truly massive interest, I may make an app or something for it to make running the overlay easier, but that's likely out of scope the time being.

Don't treat anything here as set in stone, but take what works for you and tweak and tinker as much (or as little) as you want. The balance of this system is very much in the hands of the DM.

I think the people here are right and made the level 10 feature short rest based and I buffed the capstone feature because debuffing someone for 1 turn while having to spend an action and not being able to attack said enemy was kind of weak compared to the fiend warlocks 10d10 no question asked.

Monastic Tradition: Way of the Flowing Grace v1.1

*A woman in simple robes walks down the woody path. A single vestige hangs around her neck, a symbol depicting a swirl of… water? Wind? Both? As she makes her way through the forest, light dances through the leaves above her. Then the leaves rustle, and the woman knows that danger is near. Her breathing slows, her body steadies itself, and she waits. And waits. And- a javelin flies from the trees toward her! In one effortless motion, she grabs the spear, swirls, and returns it into the trees. A choked grunts makes its way to her ear followed by a satisfying thud as the bandit falls onto the ground. As the bushes around her shake with movement, she prepares herself for battle.*

The goal with this monastic tradition was to create the fantasy of that disciplined fighter who waits for their enemy to make the first move, always responding with the perfect counter. Something similar to Toph from Avatar: The Last Airbender. Please let me know if you think I’ve realized that fantasy!

If you like what you see or if you’re just feeling generous, please consider donating to the International Medical Corps. They’re a global humanitarian organization that both provides direct medical assistance to areas in need and helps those areas develop their own healthcare systems. You can learn more about their mission [here.](https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/what-we-do/) They’re pretty busy right now, so I thought this would be a good way to help them out. If you can donate something, great! If you can’t right now, that’s fine too! Please enjoy the Way of the Flowing Grace either way :)

This one was a lot of fun; essentially the objective was to create a dangerous, well-rounded, versatile and above all, flavourful boss with a strong martial arts theme that could get as creative as the GM piloting it desires, and I feel this was a success.

Combining design elements of the Monk class with wuxia and classic staple moves from various games, the Street Fighter Hurricane Kick and Dragon Punch/Shoryuken, Liu Kang's Flying Kick, and DBZ's animation saving affinity for portraying fighting faster than the eye can see, as well as recurring parry/counter mechanics, the Transcendent Fist should satisfy those players and GMs looking for an interesting and challenging fight rich in flavour and mechanics.

If there's one thing I considered toying with it's limiting the number of times Martial Master can trigger each turn if only to reduce the amount of rolling, especially for the AoEs.

* While this ready to be used and being used by many people, it also a pre-1.0 version. There will be errors and mistakes. A lot of work is going into this system, and it has a lot of moving parts. 

* This does not list every magic item. Some of them fall into their own branches (Wands) some of them are just more tables that aren't complete yet, this is a large sampling of the ones I could include, and far more will be added in time (both custom and some of the other SRD ones I've missed).

* This system has many branches; I've previously posted Blacksmithing Alchemy, this is Enchanting. Wands have their own section (Wand Whittling! Using Wood Working tools); I've decided to include Scroll Scribing here, as it's a very helpful section to the enchanting section.

* Personally I don't use the pricing listed. These prices have been adapted to be compatible with games running more standard PHB/DMG gold values than I use, and from the feedback so far are a reasonable adaption, but personally I use a much more compressed system.

## Why do you need Crafting?
Some people may wonder - why do you need a crafting system? Isn't that what loot is for? The truth is, in some games, that's true. Not every adventurer is going to want to pursue crafting. But with a crafting system, not only can you craft what you need without finding it in a dragon hoard, what you find in that dragon hoard can be so much more.

In a game with a robust crafting system, there is no junk, there is just more opportunities and fresh possibilities. A +1 shortsword that no one can use could be the valuable basis of a new spear. Gems, gold, relics, and recyclables... all valid entry points for the crafters creativity. 

Adventurers are inherently innovative folks on a quest for creative solutions to difficult problems. Crafting gives them that toolbox.

So... why do you need crafting? You don't. But you should probably want it.

### Who can craft?
Anyone! Who can succeed in making something useful? Perhaps a bit of a different story. Crafting is not inherently tied to class, though in some cases some classes may give benefits to it (like Artificer); crafting may come from your background in the form of a tool proficiency, or it may be something you learn during your adventures following the old adage of necessity being the mother of invention.

Crafting is mostly about the time, effort, knowledge and materials. As such, most of crafting is knowing the recipe and having the time and materials needed... but a skilled craftsman works quicker and is more successful, and in this business practice makes perfect, so there are various progression modifiers that apply. Your DM can determine if your background would merit starting your adventure with any, otherwise guidelines for how to gain them are included.

### What can I craft?
Anything! But this guide is made by a mere mortal, and is thus limited in scope. This guide will provide the principles of crafting for many fields - from alchemy to engineering to woodworking. 

The basis of how crafting works is similar between each field, but the recipes, material, and most important results will be radically different... After all, a healing potion, a catapult, and a magic sword are all things you can craft, but the process for each varies quite a bit.

The goal of this document is teach you how to get started, and provide the basics that will get you a long way into your adventure, but not make a complete codex of everything that could potentially be crafted. When you hit something that doesn't appear in this document, just reference the closest items and make a bit of a leap to what extra steps might be needed to realize your vision into your D&D world!

### A Player Driven System
One of the fundamental goals and inspirations of the crafting system is to make it a player driven system. It is a system where the player can say ""**I** would like to harvest the monster for ingredients"" and ""**I** would like to forage as we go through the forest looking for alchemy reagents"" and ultimately ""**I** would like to make a healing potion"" and all those rules can be exposed in a PHB like style to the player. The DM still adjudicates many instances of them, but the ideal is to have a system in which the DM does not have to handcraft every instance of gathering materials and crafting.

### Hooking Your Players In
On the other hand, if the DM wants to get the players into it, there are some tools they can use. By far the most effective tool is to give the players reagents as part of loot that don't have an obvious place to sell them. If you give players 2 curative reagents, they are going to start looking into how they can use those, as they'd much rather have a healing potion.

If you want to go one further though, if you give them *5* curative reagents and they realize they will have a remainder of one... then they start looking into ""Well, how do we get a 6th!""

### Depth and Complexity
This system has two goals: to be simple and easy to use, and to be deep and extensible. Naturally these are somewhat at odds, and accomplished by having a great deal of optional depth. To produce standard items with standard effects, the process for finding or buying the materials and using them to make what you want to make will be straightforward. However, it always allows a degree of customization and specificity for those that look further. Whipping up a potion of healing is fairly easy, but you can also delve into the custom potions and brew something entirely unique.

How much of the detail you want to engage with as a DM can be easily adjusted by how you hand out reagents. By sticking to the standard ingredients and using their generic names, the materials are no more complicated than handing out gold or other rewards (and can even be fully converted easily to a gold based system if you want the most simplified version), but if you'd like to have specific ingredient names and exotic ingredients with special effects, those are there for you to pull from.

##### Generic Ingredients
Above and throughout the document, you will see that ingredients are referred to by generic tags like ""common curative reagent"" rather than specific natures. For example, you may harvest magical herbs, and find Kingsbane in the forest, a poisonous plant. For the purposes of crafting, this can be recorded simply as a ""common poisonous reagent"" and used as such in crafting. 

This greatly simplifies the process of crafting and recording what your supplies are. Narratively speaking, a skilled alchemist can render down the ingredients they want to use in the form they need.

Each crafting profession will have some profession wide materials that are used in their recipes - reagents for alchemy, metals for blacksmithing, etc. 

Some very rare and legendary items will have specific ingredients; this is for flavor rather than balance, though is up to your DM.

##### Camp Actions

A recommended complimentary system is the Kibbles Camp Actions which can be found [**here**](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MK0g94rlPq9A0KprEKC) and provide more formalized rules for how to make use of your time during a long rest.

1015,garvci7,jlywf9,"[**GMBinder**](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-ML0N8c4eW_W88qTVBYX)

A new little thing. Part of what has taken so long of working on crafting is that crafting is a lot more than just making things, it's about figuring out how being a person who can make stuff would be applicable to being an adventurer and how it would be integrated into adventuring.

For Blacksmithing, making new swords and armor is cool, but not something you'll be doing frequently, so I wanted to introduce a system of benefits they could benefit from far more frequently that made sense to integrate into their day to day adventuring. Not a massive benefit, but one tangible enough benefit to meaningful reward skipping a watch to work on them or getting a benefit coming out of down time.

This are intended to be used with my recently posted [Camp Actions](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MK0g94rlPq9A0KprEKC)) (taking the Craft Action) but can be used without that system as that system just formalizes what you can already do during a long rest (take a watch, spend 2 hours doing w/e, etc).

### Design Notions

#### Sharpen Weapon

I like mechanics that roll dice because people like to roll dice. This will be a bit of a mileage may vary as not one every loves rolling dice, but as a generalization people like to roll dice, and will remember a feature that lets them roll dice a lot better than a feature that gives them a static modifier. I call this the *bless* phenomena. What is +1d4 an okay modifier when +2 is generally ill advised? Because rolling dice is fun.

The benefit is relatively small, but is the sort of thing players tend to remember because it saves them from a fate players tend to hate the most - rolling bad. A player may easily forget small details, but when the 1 hits, they'll remember they have a feature that lets them reroll it.

I could interact with GWF; some diminishing returns there, but not too worried about that.

#### Maintain Armor

Temporary hit points are an easy to interact with and self sustaining system. It's a minor boost, but one that usually won't get too out of hand inherently. This is generally less value than maintaining weapons, but is also a somewhat more universally useful feature, as everyone can use some hit points.

That this feature may or may not be worth the cost at low levels is perfectly fine - if you want to get the most out of your day, it'll be worth it here and there to push your advantage.

#### Modify Armor

I think this is generally something most DMs allow by default, but makes sense to include here. Nothing really too fancy, and a big help to small creatures who rarely find armor in the right size :)

#### Modify Weapon

Ah... this one is will be controversial... Points 2 and 3 are pretty straight forward. A greataxe with a reduced damage die becomes a d10 which is just a longsword anyway, and a warhammer reduced by d2 is just a d6, which is inline for a martial light weapon.

Because it's just metal weapons, you cannot do anything funky with nets (which wouldn't really matter anyway, as making a net light wouldn't help as it's not a melee weapon). There's one potential loophole, and that's lances, though I'd say they don't apply as they are not made of metal (a metal lance would be far too heavy to wield). Some DM leeway is what is considered metal and not, use it wisely.

The first point is obviously going to be contentious. I don't think it's that bad though - it only works with non magical weapons, and I think provides some interesting options as the game goes on, but obviously it allows for some builds that are fairly powerful. You can restrict it to 2 hand weapons only if you want.

#### Repair Gear

Like modify, I think this is something most people would allow, after all, that's sort of the default point of taking blacksmithing tools. But it makes sense to include it here.

1016,gat210i,jlywf9,"[**This**](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LryJUFU_dWwhVBMfRdb) is my overall system for making weapons. That requires 2 handed for making a heavy weapon, but in this is more modifying existing weapons, so I gave them a bit more flexibility, particularly as this cannot be used on magic weapons, so runs far less risk of breaking the game.

A heavy longsword or heavy rapier is overpowered in a way, but will generally fade around level 5 as people start getting magic weapons and be a sort of ""pseudo magic weapon"" that is somewhat better than common weapons, but has some severe drawbacks. Perhaps that's not enough of a counterbalance, and if DMs are concerned by it, I'd just recommend they add the rules make it so heavy weapon is restricted to two handed.

Since the first version, I’ve worked really hard to iron out a lot of the bugs/misspellings, in addition to working towards some of the mechanical feedback I got.

* The biggest one was some knacks we’re like half-feats, so I toned back a lot of those ones.
* I did a shit ton of math in order to balance out the focus dice not only to make sure you don’t overpower other classes' early game, but also you have enough focus dice to use late game. Focus dice were turned to 2x prof for your maximum, with a level 5 ability that gives you extra equal to your wisdom score. This way the maximum you can start with is 4 instead of 4-6 like before, while the maximum was increased to 17 total.
* A lot of feedback from playtesting gave me pointers to clean up wording and limit certain abilities that were going above my intent.
* We got the seafarer and the nomad subclasses. Very much opposites to each other but thematically I’m very happy with how they turned out. The Seafarer is probably my favorite subclass for the outlander currently.
* We moved from Homebrewery to GM Binder and I don’t regret it for a moment!
* I started a subreddit ([r/lunaoslongscape](https://www.reddit.com/r/LunaOsLongscape/)) and a Ko-Fi ([Luna Os Longscape](https://ko-fi.com/lunaoslongscape))! These are places where I will post all of my content absolutely free, so if you wanted to follow my work, those are the places! People also were asking for a donation location, so I made the Ko-Fi as it seemed the least daunting to me as a creator and a good interface for posting content!

FAQ:

* **Q:** Is this just a better martial ranger?
* **A:** No, or at least it’s not intended to do be that. I designed it very much in the scenario of paladin vs fighter, when comparing to ranger. Paladin and fighter take some key notes from each other but also are vastly different from one and another. Outlander is still homebrew and needs a lot of revisions and playtesting to be balanced, but my intent is for outlander and ranger to coexist and both have their own cool things.
* **Q:** Why the d8 hit die?
* **A:** The d8 comes a lot from me wanting to be different enough from ranger, but it also to compensate for some higher level abilities. With the class, you gain immunity to poison at level 10, then you gain a damage resistance from a path knack at level 11, and the Hereafter gets resistance to necrotic at level 11 as well. I really like damage resistances cause in my experience players feel way more cool with those than getting a d12 hit die. I also wanted to make the outlander lean towards a glass knife in design. Very squishy but can deal some pretty good damage and has niche skills. This is also why I don’t give the shield proficiency to encourage a sorta reckless and damage heavy focus.
* **Q:** Why the choice to make it Str or Dex based?
* **A:** Strength based classes need some more love! I also think that thematically it fits. I could see an outlander either having remarkable strength and/or extreme dexterity to survive monsters and the wilderness.
* **Q:** Why did you choose an invocation style system for Knacks instead of creating discrete subclasses?
* **A:** I think that’s one of the biggest pitfalls a new homebrew creator can do. Giving a subclass for every single niche scenario that the class could pull off. It’s very opposite to 5e design. On the other hand, outlanders are supposed to have some niche and wild skills, so an invocation-like system felt very right to support that style of play. Also just customizable martials are rare! I’d love to see more from wizards like we’ve seen in Tasha’s
* **Q:** Do you feel like it steps on the toes of other classes since it is so diverse?
* **A:** I don’t think it’ll ever come close to another spellcaster. However it does do a lot with its knacks and that’s something I want to tone back with future revisions is making the knacks feel like a core aspect of the class instead of a tangent. Some martials do a lot, some do way less. I do think it’s possible it steps on the toes of some of them from time-to-time in terms of skills and abilities but not in terms of combat power.
* **Q:** Will there be any major changes coming to the class?
* **A:** Absolutely! I'm playing the class in a campaign at the moment, I have a player in one of my games playing it, and I'm getting a lot of feedback from people reading. There are 100% changes coming. If I think I'll entirely overhaul the class itself, probably not, however edits need to be done, things need to be changed/added, and we'll iron out the bugs as we go along!
* **Q:** Is this class difficult for beginners? Both for new players or new DMs with players that want to use it?
* **A:** That depends from player to player I think. There's a lot here for a DM to learn, mostly in terms of knacks, but there are similar enough to pre-existing mechanics that it feels somewhat intuitive. That may just be me coming at it from a design standpoint, but my friends have given me a similar reaction. I'd just tell your DM in advance what knacks you have taken so they can read and double check them. You can't switch knacks like a warlock, so you're stuck with them and thus I think it's easier to grab as a DM. Player wise, I don't think it's more involved than a spellcaster, or even half-caster, but it is for sure more complicated than the average martial. It's new and I think there's a learning curve to that. Warlocks have a lot of invocations, but we've seen them so much that we know what they do. If a player was planning on doing a spellcaster or even warlock, I don't think outlander is more complicated than those. However, outlander is a WIP and things need to be clarified, so if a weird situation comes up, I could see it being hard for a new player and DM. I'm working my hardest to fix those bits and bobs going forward!
* **Q:** Has this class been tested with multiclasses? If so, are there any broken combinations that a DM should be on the lookout for?
* **A:** It has not been tested for multiclass in a game yet (if you do let me know!!!) but it has been theory crafted pretty heavily. When thinking about it, I don't think there's anything broken about the combinations that a normal class wouldn't have. Action surge breaks things, cleric is OP and uses Wisdom, etc. If you do think of something game breaking or abusable, please do let me know as I want to iron out those wrinkles!
* **Q:** Can I give feedback?
* **A:** Yes! Please do! I've got a long road ahead of me to making the class where I want it for sure. Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated!

Here are some variants of the famous Counterspell that allows you to either cast a duplicate spell or boost the power of another spell. I know what you're thinking - why spend a 3rd level spell slot for the equivalent of a 1st level spell when I could just cast it on my turn? These spells' uses come from allowing you to cast spells not in your spell list, and to cast an extra spell on a round. If you really need a specific spell to go through before your turn (like Feather Fall or Faerie Fire), you can get an extra chance to do so!

Although not entirely true to the actual method, I think that the resemblance and similiraty to the process lends it the gravity and real-life-likeness, that, in my opinion, should be found in any transmutation spell.

The list of changes are as follows:
- Aura of the Vanguard- range increased from 5’/10’ to 10’/20’.
- Shepherd’s Guidance- bonus changed from 1d4 to half your proficiency bonus, rounded down.
- Righteous Shepherd- name changed to Righteous Guardian, flavor text slightly altered, changed disadvantage on WIS saving throws to disadvantage on all saving throws, TempHP gained changed from 1d8 + CHA to 5 + CHA.

1037,gdwtgfm,k2tzbj,"After quite a long hiatus (and forgetting my old reddit account password) I've finally updated my class: The Arcane Armsman! The armsman is a class all about combining martial abilities with arcane ones- without the need for spells. The Arcane Armsman has 5 subclasses- The Order of the Pawn, the Order of the Queen, the Order of the Knight, the Order of the Rook, and the Order of the Bishop. Each order focuses on a different aspect of combat-

The Pawn focuses on team play and perfecting base class abilities.

The Queen focuses on two weapon fighting and mobility.

The Knight focuses on shield fighting and reflecting damage.

The Rook focuses on heavy armor and damage absorption.

And the Bishop borrows spells from the wizard class, as well as having support abilities.

The Arcane Armsman's main pull, however are the Arcane Arts- abilities that fall somewhere between spells and eldritch invocations that scale with the player. Currently there are 37 different Arcane Arts, with some having subclass or level requirements. This is probably going to be the final version of the class, so I'd love to hear what you guys think!

This is a little side project I decided to formalize a little bit, and is generally the jumping off point for making an encounter that your players will hate love. That your players will love. Definitely that. Well, at least they tend to be memorable.

This actually harkens back to some of the older and stranger monsters in D&D that have largely been made more standard in 5e, but sometimes old tools are the best tools when you want to mix things up. Monsters that simply cannot be felled by normal means, or are at least extremely difficult to take down. The last vestiges of this sort of thing in 5e are Werewolves, Vampires, Trolls, Hydras, Rakshasa, and the like, but all those creatures have two real problems: one, they are a victim of their own success and most players can make an educated guess what their weakness is, and, and two, they usually just don't go far enough and often end up just falling down to brute force anyway.

While there will always be room for a monster-by-monster boutique creation experience for each monster, the following is a more holistic approach that provides some consistent mechanics and tables for creating a monster that'll be a memorable encounter.

Meanwhile the Half Dragons were created through the union of a dragon parent and his/her mortal lover. Or through two Half Dragons starting a family, or even a Half Dragon and another mortal lover. Basically they were not artifically created, but naturally. You can find more information here, where I combined everything I could find about these races:

1062,fpkjdpl,ge0oy3,"So my gnoll tiefling has gone through a few updates since last time I posted it here. I've gotten a lot of good feedback which I really appreciate. 

Since last time there have been a few updates, mostly centered around the lore and for clarity. This is not longer a tiefling variant in the same way it once was, mechanically and substantively it is easier to consider it as a new race. I think it makes sense that an Abyssal tiefling is likely to be different enough so that it merits a separate race than just a tiefling variant for a different archdemon of the Hells. They are still based on the tiefling race, just modified as to what kinds of magic, resistances, ability scores, etc. they get.

Reflecting in that, the Abyssal Legacy feature is chosen at random to represent the chaotic heritage of gnoll tieflings. I have included a variant feature that allows one to take the popular Rampage ability of gnolls, slightly modified, for this race as well if you prefer a more martial type character.

Lore-wise, it didn't make much sense for these to live as part of gnoll packs I decided, who would have sought to kill rather than subjugate Yeenoghu's enemies. However you want to adapt the race to the lore or your world or campaign is completely fine, this is just going off the 5e Volo's Guide to Monsters description of gnolls.

Lastly, I think this race is pretty flexible in terms of optimization for different classes and builds. This partly reflects their human heritage, but also the tenacious, adaptable, and scrappy role of hyenas which can fill in multiple roles like a hunter or scavenger, etc.

As always, any feedback is greatly appreciated, and [Link to the Homebrewery](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/-PVfz6fPu).",DnDHomebrew,Gnoll Tiefling (Version 1.3),5e
1063,g8oo7w5,jabwuf,"**Design Notes:**

This is probably my first devil/fiend design since the glory days of 4E. Effectively I wanted to create a natural 'evolution' of the Merregon devil: fiends spawned from souls of soldiers that served evil willingly and without reservation. The idea was an elite shock troop with intelligence and a firm grasp of tactics that would remain true to the Merregon credo of unshakeable discipline and loyalty, and this was the result.

I have to admit that the Warhammer 40k Bloodletter played a considerable part in terms of inspiring the overall aesthetic (as one can obviously see per the images used, and thematic music picked), as well as the overall concept of intimidating, traditional looking fiends ever hungry, primed and striving for battle, wielding deadly flaming hellblades that could cleave any armor with ease.

Though I understand the naming convention of devils is to name them after actual physical features (horns, barbs, beards, etc), the angle I was going for is that war, fighting and their swords have become so iconic, inseparable and integral to their identity that this is effectively what they became named for. 

Mechanically, Sword Devils are aggressive, melee exclusive low-mid CR fiends that can either pose as a boss for lower level parties or as mooks for mid to high level parties. They are able to deal with multiple threats using their Cleaving Strike, or problematic individuals with Impale, while Infernal Advance provides explosive mobility.

Additional details are on the second page.

This update makes a number of very impactful changes that should help smooth out certain issues with class progression, adds a new support-oriented subclass, the Dragon Adept, and makes a number of smaller changes to a variety of features. 

**Feedback is very much appreciated**. I am always trying to improve both mechanics and flavor, and I would love to hear what you think, be it good or bad!

**Changes since last version:**

* Added Bestow Flight and Ascension to the Dragon Adept. Changed Disciple's Meditation to only recharge on a long rest. Implemented the Dragon Adept

* Added two additional pieces of artwork

* Reduced class skill proficiencies from 4 to 3, in light of recent useful additions to the class kit

* Reduced Dragon's Breath damage scaling by one increment to once again align with uneven levels, to better match spellcaster level progression

* Decreased the range of Devour Magic to 10 ft. (from 30 ft.), but caused the range to now increase to 60 ft. at 5th level, in order to better regulate the immediate power of the effect at low levels

* Moved Absorb Magic to 3rd level, from 4th

* Removed the AC cap on Dragon Scales, because it was potentially confusing and largely irrelevant even in niche cases

* Removed Strength of Body, and replaced it with Dragon's Might & Rend and Ruin, in order to more elegantly scale weapon damage and to address the dragon's stat-hungry issues

* Removed Forged From Trial, and replaced it with Legendary Resistance, because Dragon's Might rendered it obsolete

* Moved Dragon's Breath (three uses) to 13th level, moved Devour Magic (two uses) to 17th level, and moved the 17th-level Embodiment feature to 15th level, in order to have a better progression of offensive and defensive tools in light of the introduction of Dragon's Might

* Renamed Strength of Self to Force of Self

* Reimplemented 11th level damage scaling on Venomous Sting

* Increased the damage of Skewering Quills from 1d6 to 1d8

* Added a clause addressing cold and poison Constitution saves to Dragon's Breath, and removed Vaporous Breath.

* Added Languages to racial traits

* Slightly increased Glide & Fly Speed at lower levels to be consistently faster than walk speed

* Changed Assimilate to grant hit points instead of temporary hit points, to better co-exist with subclass options for temporary hit points, but halved the hit points gained

* Added an NPC stat block to Feature Design",DnDHomebrew,The Demi-Dragon 2.9 - A feature-complete race-class combination,5e Workshop
1073,fev1422,epk55k,"I don't know your friend, but I think in this case it may be a question of them not being terribly familiar with D&D design. If I didn't know that 5th, 11th, and 17th were intentionally designed to be the dividing line between the 'tiers of play' of D&D, I'd also think it was a broken feature. It's supposed to be stronger than an ASI—by a lot. If you take a 11th level generic fighter with no subclass, 20 Str (which he spent his 6th level bonus ASI on), and a greatsword, he'll deal an average of 36 damage from just attacking. If you take a dragon under similar conditions but remove the 11th stat boost (ergo, 18 Str), it'll average 25.5 damage. If you add the stat boost and Rend & Ruin, the dragon averages 32. This also requires the dragon to spend its bonus action, while the fighter is just using an action. Other martial classes should average ~30+ damage at 11th level. 

Of course, the dragon gets a bunch of other benefits from the stat boost, like higher skills, saves, AC, and HP. The survivability it kind of just needs, because it's just kind of not very survivable in the first place, but the skill boost and the ability to hit 22 in a score are fairly good functionalities. 

At 1st level, the Fighter's Second Wind is better than the dragon's Devour Magic (for healing purposes), averaging 6.5 hp as a BA, while Devour Magic requires a valid target, takes an action, and only heals on a succesful check, for what will be, at best, 4 HP (with 16 Con). At its best scaling (20th level 22 Con), it heals for 26, while the fighter will average 25.5—though at that point, the dragon can use it twice, so there's that. 

I think it's worth being concerned about the ability to dispel magic at 1st level, since it's usually an effect that is available to 5th level characters, but at that stage the dragon has a bunch of restrictions on it, to the point that you may only want to even use it for out-of-combat story purposes or after a fight has ended but a spell is still lingering, for the explicit purposes of healing. 

All that being said, I've been applying a series of nerfs to some of the dragon's functionalities over the last couple of days—you can view them easily by using the [GMBinder link](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LpZX_fRKhLCn-mr_64B).

1074,fquotyn,gl238f,"So I found a few divine-themed bard classes that reminded me of some older edition prestige classes like chorister, loresinger, etc. None of them really seemed to offer the diversity, adaptability, and flexibility that I was looking for, so I whipped up this homebrew.

Whether your bard is a choir singer that ran away from home to find adventure, a cunning pickpocket for the church of Mask, a writer of beauty for the Church of Sune, a lorekeeper for Oghma, a flutist for animals of Silvanus, etc. you can adapt this subclass to fit the bard.

Check out my profile if you like my stuff. Recently posted some lycanthropy stuff as well as a full set of Subclasses and Race options are available on DMsGuild.

**Changes from Version 3**:

\+ adjusted spell list to use only PHB spells, and avoid some overlap with other patrons.

\+ Dragon's Blessing Feature replaced at Level 1 with Dragon Tongue (breath weapon based on patron type)

\+ Dragon's Blessing moved to lvl 6. Changed from 1 resistance at level 1, 6, 10, 14 to 2 at 6, and 1 at 10 and 14.

\+ Presence of the Wyrm renamed to Dragon Spirit and changed Skill buff to 1/SR auto succeed on save/check.

\+ Fearsome Aura renamed to Draconic Supremacy and moved to lvl 14. Removed effect ending range/line of sight, and added 24 hour immunity after save. Stronger and more inline with Dragon ability.

\+Draconic Shape was removed and will be used in Druid Circle.

**Dracolich**:

\+ Option expanded to include Tiamat and Bahamut.

\+ 3 spell lists based on choice.

\+ Yes, Bahamut grants force damage breath, but also forces you into force resistance which isn't as common so this should help balance somewhat.

\+ These dragons would be stronger patrons technically, and do provide more options compared to a typical dragon when choosing damage/resistances. I'm considering them a variant Subclass",DnDHomebrew,"Warlock Patron: The Dragon! (now including Bahamut, Tiamat, and Dracolich options) - V4.0 OC by me",

Hello Adventurers!

I’d like to introduce a new Constitution-based Support class: The Cook. Cook characters are meant to fill a support role first, as they buff their allies with magic morsels of food, and a tank role second, as their high hit points and sturdy bodies weather the occasional hit. The Cook has two subclasses: the \*\*Baker\*\* which reinforces the Cook’s main role as a Support, and the \*\*Butcher\*\* which lets the Cook fill the tertiary role of damage-dealer. More subclasses are planned for the future.

I’d love to hear any feedback you have for the class! Please hit me with your thoughts on balance, theme, presentation, etc.

1079,gb83frm,joilas,"Hello everyone! 

I have been working over the past few months on a lot of content. Too much, some might say (including myself at times). The reason for this is because I have been working diligently on a massive project: my own setting guide. This setting, known as **Yvarra**, has been the primary setting for my home games for years and I am excited to announce that I am making a complete guide for it. This guide, known as **Yorviing’s Guide to Yvarra** will feature a brand new setting filled with [strange and unusual gods and demigods](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MGQEKDQ9U67Wtw7Ql0A), forgotten and ancient magic, and terrifying creatures that lurk in the dark. This setting book will aim to give both players and GMs alike with a wealth of options to run campaigns and stories within Yvarra, and I hope to release a preview of the project soon!

Today I decided to show off one of the wizard subclasses that is going into YGY. Originally shown in my old YAG project (but this has been completely redone from the ground up), today’s subclass, **Arcane Tradition: Pyromancy**, is about wizards who focus on mastering the art of creating and controlling flame, studying fire in all of its forms, in some ways becoming a kind of off shoot of an evoker or even a diviner. 

I hope you are all having a great day, and I hope that everyone enjoys this new subclass — **Arcane Tradition: Pyromancy** :D

**Write-Up:**

>*Word Slay*'s theme is saying terrible one-liners or movie references; its damage is comparable to or less than College of Whisper's feature and ***can*** involve your party giving you a grade (which can be socially fun). Scales with level, but at a slower rate than Whisper's.  
>  
>*World Play*'s theme is about really messing with people, and thus has no recharge, but at cost of being ignored on a failure, which is enough of a punishment for a Bard.  
>  
>*Word Clay* is about changing spells, which offers a lot of utility. This is very dependent on if your DM is able to balance spells on the fly and can vary wildly in power. You might work out a list of alterations with your DM. Its versatility may mean it should be limited to 1/short rest, limited to spells of 1st level or higher, or the same altered spell cannot be cast for a week. It's up to your DM.  
>  
>*Word Spray* is mainly about terrifying your enemies with some wicked one-liners - and if you actually make a kill with the one-liner like in an action movie, you get your Bardic Inspiration back.

This is a continuation of [Part I of this series](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/jixpzp/feats_for_the_faithful_by_kibblestasty_express/). At the time I asked you what gods you wanted to see next, and these are a stab at those gods. To be transparent here, these feats are not necessarily tested to my usual level of rigor - they are ideas I thought were cool and did some balancing around, but they haven't been particularly extensively playtested or anything.

* Tyr
* Sune
* Lathander
* Helm
* Illmater
* Selune

### Gods in Part II

* Tiamat
* Bahamut
* Marthammer Duin

* Kossuth

### Design Notes & FAQ

> Can you do X God!?

Maybe; if there's interest in Part III I'll do more gods.

> Will you do gods outside of the Forgotten Realms?

Maybe, probably not. It comes down to that those are the gods I'm familiar with. I don't play my games in the Forgotten Realms, but I loosely use it's pantheon, so these mirror how I know these gods for the most part. It's a lot harder to do gods from settings I don't know as well (I know Greyhawk or something fairly well too, but those gods aren't used as widely and would have a lot of overlap with Forgotten Realms gods in roles).

> These are Overpowered! Or Underpowered!

Potentially; I gave these some thought, but they are not heavily playtested. I'm going to be level with you though, every time I post feats there are people that will claim they are too strong, yet generally few people playing in games that allow them end up using them unless they are given for free. The reality of it is the that how powerful a feat has to be to be actually used in a typically game is quite high - balancing feats against Linguist or the like is generally pointless, as no one uses it unless it's for niche RP or was given to them for free.

> These should be Boons, not feats!

Feel free to use them as boons, not feats! Or as both! Or neither! I write them as feats because I like to give players options and choices.

> I hate Proficiency bonus scaling! Feats shouldn't scale!

Proficiency bonus has been decreed from on high as the new laws of the land, and who am I to saw it's wrong. I find that while I have some qualms with how it's being used in subclasses, it works quite well for feats, as it helps balance a feat taken by a V Human and feat taken later in the game. Plenty of feats scale, and feats that don't are typically bad (GWM, Magic Initiate, and others all effectively scale in one or another). That said, I fully appreciate not everyone loves this way of designing feats, I just find it works.

> Where is Burn from? Why is it included here? What is Occultist?

It is a spell made for [my Occultist](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-M-WtrKeZNFdEXq0MKXw). I included it here because it did what I wanted a spell to do, and I felt it generally worked well. It's a very simple spell, and I wanted to extend the effect a little.

> How can you write an FAQ when something is just being posted?

I've posted to reddit before.

The biggest balance changes that I made ever since I've released it were that I lowered the additional single target damage on the Dragon Form to half your level, increased the breath weapon scaling after more feedback, and I made it so that the Copper half dragon could use the vicious mockery cantrip as a bonus action if she takes the Dash action on her turn. And I've also given the Blue half dragon the Stealth skill, to make him feel more complete. Out of curiosity, which subrace did you find the most interesting?

I plan on posting my Oath of Draconic Majesty and Dragon Domain this week, featuring artwork from another artist. But I am currently finalizing my revised lizardfolk, revised kobold, and Path of the Chromatic dragon homebrews. Here are the WIP's in case you are interested:

1085,fy89giq,g7xcqc,"Well I'm really glad to hear that :) My intend was to make D&D more interesting for players, so I'm quite happy to hear that I succeeded!

As a matter of fact, I also made a revised draconic bloodline for a friend of mine, who liked to go into melee as a sorcerer. It is mostly the same, but this version will allow you additional options. I have also added a Dragon Magic homebrew, and both will be added to the final project:

Also the Copper half dragon has always been a tricky one, as I wasn't sure how to make their former bland trait more interesting. And from the playtests it does seem that people like this. 

Speaking of which, playtesters are trying this next homebrew that I made, which is inspired by the Copper dragons and how they prefer to taunt and mentally weaken enemies into submission. I had to spend some time on balancing it, but so far the reactions seem to be positive:

It’s unfinished at the moment but I’m slowly getting back into finishing up all my homebrews. Please let me know what you think, would love the feedback!",DnDHomebrew,"Fist of Vengeance - magic item, features in comments",5e
1087,gbik97r,jphd4l,"All very true observations!

As for the THP I’ve since bumped it down to 3 at 2nd Lvl, 6 at 6th, 9 at 10th, and 12 at 14th. I get what you mean and I considered the comparison between Storm Herald as well but I will say that 1) Storm Herald is generally regarded as over nerfed from its UA inception and 2) the THP barbarians get end up benefiting from their B/S/P resistance which makes it doubly effective. Instead of comparing it to Storm Herald I looked to the Glamour bard, which gave a burst of THP and also offered movement to affected party members. There’s multiple trade offs between the three features but I feel with the adjusted numbers it’s not terribly overpowered given the action to set up and the small aura to stay effective. Will see how it plays out!

I’ve also since updated the **Bramble Armaments** thanks to the feedback in this thread to have the retaliation damage be 1d4 scaling at levels but only deal that damage once per turn. And I changed the bonus 1d6 on a hit to a 1d4 as well.

For **Iron Bark Armor** I have it set to scale at 17 at 2nd level, 18 at 6th, 19 at 10th, and 20 at 14th. This makes it not as strong early but still grants a significant boon later on. I feel having it function similar to the **Barkskin** spell is the cleanest way to do it. Allowing it to stack with shields and magic gear just pushes the Druid to absurd ACs that makes it outpace other classes. This way you can still have above average AC while wielding two handed weapons and such. 

Thanks for the feedback!

It's not a 100% 1-to-1 representation but I think I did a pretty got job translating the mechanics into 5e, making it very strong but also very risky to use. I gave it to my party at level 7, about ~15 sessions ago, and so far they've barely used it. One of their main enemies that has been pursuing them for quite a while keeps returning from the dead so since they got it they've been super excited to be able to use it on them, so I'd advise having the players have to deal with some of those immortals before you give it to them so they appreciate it more.

1094,g5g95z7,is24xb,"> I think the Patriot is just as MAD as the monk no? Patriot has Dex/Str, Con and Cha while monk has Dex, Wis, Con.

I think it's less MAD, because the Patriot is less dependant on CHA (mostly uses), than the monk is on WIS (AC/DC ⚡)

> Hehee, it's actually even more broken than you thought. Three quarters cover grants +5 AC and +5 to Dex saves. So without granting bonus to an ally, this let's you get +5 AC and +5 Dex, while Dodge gives disadvantage for opponents to attack you plus advantage on Dex saves. Typically advantage is roughly equal to +5 bonus (though it varies at different levels), so this is similar to Dodge. There is the extra advantage to getting pushed that Dodge doesn't have, and the speed penalty you're right is not really much of a penalty. I just thought Dodge is slightly better because someone can ignore your cover if they sharpshoot you (which I guess not many NPCs will have) or if you're surrounded. But monks have to waste ki to get a bonus dodge while this class gets it for free. And then there's the bonus to your allies. So you're right, it's definitely broken. What about requiring an action to enter this stance? 

I just assumed you won't get the shields AC bonus additionally to the cover for no reason. That's how it should work though imo. More on that on your other post for your changed feature.

> Interesting feature, my only concern is it's taking one of the [Shield Master feat](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/feat:shield-master)'s feature (the 2nd one), which this class will most likely take, so there's some overlap there. The second part is reflavored Dodge which makes sense. 

The subclass includes all parts of the feat with some buffs, so it won't take it. The reason is, that the feat includes a lot of stuff you wanna do with your shield, but not exactly in the way I imagined it for the subclass. If you wanna take a look: [Spartiate (Shield)](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/pTGDykqi5) I don't really like the lvl 18 feature though. When i more or less finished it I realized, that I didn't create the spear class I intended, but a shield class, so I made a variant, that fits the theme, that I was looking for [Spartiate (Spear)](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/jem4jM2mr)

I don't like early Cap, as he's too clean, a real goodie two shoes. First movie he was really annoying; the big head on the small body was ridiculous, the villain was weird and I don't like WW2 setting overall. Peggy was hella hot though!

I don't really know whats my deal with the winter soldier though, thats why I said it doesn't deserve my underappreciation. I guess I disliked it mostly because of the first one and I didn't like Cap until later, when he struggled with his virtuosity and became more raw. I don't particular like Bucky and Falcon either so they are now help for the movie as well to me.

1104,g9cz1z4,je91fk,"Another fun one.

Yes, I totally set out to recreate the T-1000 in a stat block, albeit with a fantasy veneer. Sadly I had to omit a few things as the stat block was already getting (necessarily) crowded and complex in order to duplicate its essential capabilities, like having the golem temporarily lose *Quicksilver Form* and become slowed upon receiving enough cold damage, but on the whole, I feel it was faithful to Robert Patrick's iconic character.

Narratively, Quicksilver Golems are highly intelligent, amorphous constructs that truly exceptional wizards, liches, and other arcanists would create in order to pursue complex and longer-term goals, particularly those that involve subterfuge, intrigue and manipulation. However, due to their intellect and complexity, a scarce few may achieve true free will and independence, and can thus menace (or work with) your PCs as free agents. Perhaps most alarming of all is the possibility of a free Quicksilver Golem learning and perfecting the process of creating others of its kind.

Mechanically they make for deadly assassins and infiltrators that are easily capable of getting past most defenses and sneaking up on their quarry with either their divination/truesight thwarting shapeshifting, ability to compress to tiny sizes and fit through minute niches, or some combination thereof. When opportunities are less obvious they employ their considerable intelligence and cunning, and ability to form tools and weapons from their bodies to arrive at a solution.

EDIT: Changing Terminate from a trait trigger to an action to improve the stat block formatting and avoid same turn grapple + Terminates.

We will be doing an item of each rarity, for each class, which makes 48 items in total! So, starting off, we have a little power boost for barbarians, which lets them take full advantage of their reckless abandon, in exchange for taking even more punishment than usual!

We hope you enjoy! If you like this item and want to see more, consider [supporting us on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/join/2920968?)! It helps us get these items out to you every single day!

See you tomorrow!

1122,f84d8zu,dyzovu,"Chevalier Mice spend their days wandering around marketplaces, where they earn their pay as fencers in stage plays, or win it as duelists. While some duels are to the death, most Chevalier Mice choose to stop at first blood, preferring to duel for the honor and artistry of the battle itself.

This creature is inspired by Redwall, The Chronicles of Narnia, and the simple thought that it would be funny if a mouse could force you into a duel.

UPDATES - upped INT to 10 so the mouse's level of sentience makes sense, fixed the skills, changed alignment to lawful good, Compelled Duel changed from an action+bonus action to just a bonus action, changed footwork to a variation of the mobile feat to improve the combat flow:   [https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/B1rqiyfZ3r](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/B1rqiyfZ3r)

1123,erkem8c,c2b4qc,"Glad you said that, because I was just about to say: I totally want to swipe and tweak this for my group's games. And I get your concerns, I'm just of a different mindset on them.

\- Healing word has advantages that this cantrip doesn't; it's a bonus action to use, can be used at range, and can return unconscious allies to battle.

\- I don't think this takes the place of a short rest. Yes, you can spam hit points, but there's resources ([better explained here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/4kdx7a/5e_what_classes_get_the_most_value_out_of_a_short/)) that return on a short rest this cantrip doesn't help with.

That said, healing just allows people to get back to the action faster, and I like abilities that keep the action going. I think this cantrip solves the 'unlimited healing' cantrip problem, and gives the DM more flexibility in what challenges he can throw at his party without TPK. Much will come down to what kind of game you want to run.

These limbs not only let heroes spice up their adventures and strategy with different abilities, but also offer a chance for those wanting to become like the heroes they heard so much about in story, but feel like they can’t due to being dealt a bad hand in life. These prosthetics, available in a wide variety of materials, prices ranges, and even origins, allow to not only replace what was lost, but potentially make it better. You may have been dealt a bad hand, but you could always just replace.

Hey all! Hope you enjoyed this homebrew! This set of magic items is from a long list of prosthetic ideas that I plan on posting more of in the near future in different parts. This is to show you the wide variety of what could be available to anyone missing a limb (or even if you still have all your limbs, if you don’t want it to literally cost an arm and a leg).

1125,g0mo0s1,i54qnv,"Rope Dart, *Martial Melee Weapon*

Finesse, two-handed, thrown (15/20), special

Cost: 20 gp | Damage: 1d6 piercing | Weight: 3 lb.

*The rope dart consists of a piercing blade affixed to the end of a length of rope. The rope can be swung around the body, using the arms and legs as pivot points to build momentum. As the rope unwinds, the blade can be flung at nearby foes.*

You are considered to be using this weapon's *thrown* property even when within 5 feet of your target. Thus, you have disadvantage when making such an attack.

Hey, everyone! This is my first post here. Hope you like this weapon inspired by Scorpion from Mortal Kombat! Any feedback about this weapon's balance would be greatly appreciated! Here is the [GM Binder link](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-ME4Gz8n6oojbBydgHN6).

EDIT: Thanks for the feedback everyone! The GM Binder link now has an updated version. I changed ""thrown (15/20)"" to ""thrown (15/30)"" and changed the *special* text. The changes make it more clear when you retain your hold on the weapon and also allow you to fully throw it for a longer range attack at disadvantage.

New *special* text: ""All attacks with this weapon use its *thrown* property. For attacks at ranges up to 15 feet, you retain your hold on the rope and can pull the blade back as a free action. Following an attack beyond 15 feet, the weapon can be retrieved anywhere along the last 15 feet of its trajectory.""",DnDHomebrew,Rope Dart – New Non-Magical Weapon,5e

I’ve decided to post a new homebrew every week in an effort to raise money for the International Medical Corps. Here’s post #15!

Spell - Speak with Objects

You can talk to people. You can talk to animals. You can talk to plants. Heck, you can even talk to dead people, so why can’t you talk to your sword? Or that rock over there. *Speak with Objects* lets you do that! It also lets your DM roleplay as a steadfast iron door or an army’s zealous banner or a pirate ship’s foul-mouthed cannon.

If you like what you see or if you’re just feeling generous, please consider donating to the International Medical Corps. They’re a global humanitarian organization that both provides direct medical assistance to areas in need and helps those areas develop their own healthcare systems. You can learn more about their mission [here.](https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/what-we-do/) They’re pretty busy right now, so I thought this would be a good way to help them out. If you can donate something, great! If you can’t right now, that’s fine too! Please enjoy *Speak with Objects* either way :)

1128,f8axw96,dzyy6u,"Daughters of the Snows can be found hiding in the shade of forests nearby peasant villages, secretly watching as they live out their daily lives. Born from the snow of winter, the daughters live a cold existence, unable to enjoy the light of day or the warmth of a hug without harming themselves or others. They spend their days in solitude, yearning for the relationships they fear they can never have.

This creature is inspired by the various folklore stories about the character Snegurochka. I decided to go with the name ""Daughter of the Snows"" (the title of a ballet adaptation) and not Snow Maiden, because the modern connotation of ""maiden"" doesn't feel right for the idea I was aiming for, which is a lonely child rather than an older girl/woman. I also mixed aspects from several versions of the lore, as well as introduced things that I thought would make it more interesting for D&D. Essentially, this is not meant to perfectly mirror any single tale of Snegurochka, but draw inspiration from them all.

1129,g18tssw,i8jwiq,"From the Seven Years War to the American Revolution, the colonial battlefields of the 18th century saw significant developments in combined arms fighting. American, British, and French armies deployed line infantry as their primary force—columns of men standing shoulder to shoulder, firing in massed musket volleys—but rangers, skirmishers, and light infantry took on an increasingly important role. 

Though expensive and delicate weapons, long rifles in the hands of colonial sharpshooters proved devastating at range. Dragoons and other light horse regiments typically armed themselves with short-barreled carbines, drawing lances for cavalry charges. Hardscrabble marines in the Royal Navy lobbed axes and primitive grenades during boarding actions. Militiamen, meanwhile, used whatever small arms they had on hand—fowlers, blunderbusses, or other hunting weapons.

These new weapons are designed to be compatible with the 5e firearm rules, particularly the Gunslinger subclass. The flintlocks pack an incredible punch… because if you hit a guy with a .70 caliber musket ball, they're probably not gonna walk it off. As muzzle loaded weapons though, most of them have the Reload 1 trait, meaning they require 1 action or 1 attack to reload after firing. 

Prices here are listed in pounds stirling. £1 is equal to 20 shillings (or 10 gp).  Here’s a [GMBinder link](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MEUxzSRW9kf5wYfT0Oj).

This is my new and improved expansion on the undead race I posted a week or two ago.

On the links below you’ll be able to find the updated stats for the base Undead traits as well as for the Skeleton and Zombie. You’ll also find the new subrace in the Wight, a new variant option in Positive Energy Undead, and a few racial feats that really help flesh out (heh) the race.

Going by the [Detect Balance](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vq1kz6PRAbw5LHy6amH-bNb4OuB8DBXL1RsZROt03Sc/edit#gid=0) guide the non variant Undead and subraces together clock in at about a 32-33  (assuming the negatives of having the undead creature type outweigh the positives (estimating a -2/-0.5 impact)), and the Positive Energy Undead variant lingers around a 35-36.

Hope you enjoy
